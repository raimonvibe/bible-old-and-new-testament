          "content": "     [1] In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.  [2] The earth was formless and empty. Darkness was on the surface of the deep and God’s Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.\n     [3] God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.  [4] God saw the light, and saw that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness.  [5] God called the light “day”, and the darkness He called “night”. There was evening and there was morning, the first day.\n     [6] God said, “Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.”  [7] God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so.  [8] God called the expanse “sky”. There was evening and there was morning, a second day.\n     [9] God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear;” and it was so.  [10] God called the dry land “earth”, and the gathering together of the waters He called “seas”. God saw that it was good.  [11] God said, “Let the earth yield grass, herbs yielding seeds, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with their seeds in it, on the earth;” and it was so.  [12] The earth yielded grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with their seeds in it, after their kind; and God saw that it was good.  [13] There was evening and there was morning, a third day.\n     [14] God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs to mark seasons, days, and years;  [15] and let them be for lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth;” and it was so.  [16] God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He also made the stars.  [17] God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light to the earth,  [18] and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. God saw that it was good.  [19] There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.\n     [20] God said, “Let the waters abound with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the sky.”  [21] God created the large sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind. God saw that it was good.  [22] God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.”  [23] There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.\n     [24] God said, “Let the earth produce living creatures after their kind, livestock, creeping things, and animals of the earth after their kind;” and it was so.  [25] God made the animals of the earth after their kind, and the livestock after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind. God saw that it was good.\n     [26] God said, “Let’s make man in our image, after our likeness. Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over the livestock, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”  [27] God created man in His own image. In God’s image He created Him; male and female He created them.  [28] God blessed them. God said to them, “Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the sky, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”  [29] God said, “Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree, which bears fruit yielding seed. It will be your food.  [30] To every animal of the earth, and to every bird of the sky, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food;” and it was so.\n     [31] God saw everything that He had made, and, behold, it was very good. There was evening and there was morning, a sixth day.\n"

          "content": "     [1] The heavens, the earth, and all their vast array were finished.  [2] On the seventh day God finished His work which He had done; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done.  [3] God blessed the seventh day, and made it holy, because He rested in it from all His work of creation which He had done.\n     [4] This is the history of the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Yahweh God made the earth and the heavens.  [5] No plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Yahweh God had not caused it to rain on the earth. There was not a man to till the ground,  [6] but a mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole surface of the ground.  [7] Yahweh God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into His nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.  [8] Yahweh God planted a garden eastward, in Eden, and there He put the man whom He had formed.  [9] Out of the ground Yahweh God made every tree to grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food, including the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.  [10] A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became the source of four rivers.  [11] The name of the first is Pishon: it flows through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;  [12] and the gold of that land is good. Bdellium and onyx stone are also there.  [13] The name of the second river is Gihon. It is the same river that flows through the whole land of Cush.  [14] The name of the third river is Hiddekel. This is the one which flows in front of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates.  [15] Yahweh God took the man, and put Him into the garden of Eden to cultivate and keep it.  [16] Yahweh God commanded the man, saying, “You may freely eat of every tree of the garden;  [17] but you shall not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for in the day that you eat of it, you will surely die.”\n     [18] Yahweh God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make Him a helper comparable to Him.”  [19] Out of the ground Yahweh God formed every animal of the field, and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what He would call them. Whatever the man called every living creature became its name.  [20] The man gave names to all livestock, and to the birds of the sky, and to every animal of the field; but for man there was not found a helper comparable to him.  [21] Yahweh God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep. As the man slept, He took one of His ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place.  [22] Yahweh God made a woman from the rib which He had taken from the man, and brought her to the man.  [23] The man said, “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She will be called ‘woman,’ because she was taken out of Man.”  [24] Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother, and will join with his wife, and they will be one flesh.  [25] The man and his wife were both naked, and they were not ashamed.\n"

          "content": "     [1] Now the serpent was more subtle than any animal of the field which Yahweh God had made. He said to the woman, “Has God really said, ‘You shall not eat of any tree of the garden’?”\n     [2] The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees of the garden,  [3] but not the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden. God has said, ‘You shall not eat of it. You shall not touch it, lest you die.’”\n     [4] The serpent said to the woman, “You won’t really die,  [5] for God knows that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”\n     [6] When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took some of its fruit, and ate. Then she gave some to her husband with her, and he ate it, too.  [7] Their eyes were opened, and they both knew that they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together, and made coverings for themselves.  [8] They heard Yahweh God’s voice walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and His wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden.\n     [9] Yahweh God called to the man, and said to Him, “Where are you?”\n     [10] The man said, “I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; so I hid myself.”\n     [11] God said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?”\n     [12] The man said, “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate it.”\n     [13] Yahweh God said to the woman, “What have you done?”\n    The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”\n     [14] Yahweh God said to the serpent,\n  “Because you have done this,\n    you are cursed above all livestock,\n    and above every animal of the field.\n  You shall go on your belly\n    and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.\n   [15] I will put hostility between you and the woman,\n    and between your offspring and her offspring.\n  He will bruise your head,\n    and you will bruise his heel.”\n     [16] To the woman he said,\n  “I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth.\n    You will bear children in pain.\n  Your desire will be for your husband,\n    and he will rule over you.”\n     [17] To Adam he said,\n  “Because you have listened to your wife’s voice,\n    and have eaten from the tree,\n    about which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat of it,’\n    the ground is cursed for your sake.\n  You will eat from it with much labor all the days of your life.\n     [18] It will yield thorns and thistles to you;\n    and you will eat the herb of the field.\n   [19] You will eat bread by the sweat of your face until you return to the ground,\n    for you were taken out of it.\n  For you are dust,\n    and you shall return to dust.”\n     [20] The man called his wife Eve because she would be the mother of all the living.  [21] Yahweh God made garments of animal skins for Adam and for His wife, and clothed them.\n     [22] Yahweh God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. Now, lest He reach out His hand, and also take of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever—”  [23] Therefore Yahweh God sent Him out from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which He was taken.  [24] So he drove out the man; and he placed cherubim at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.\n"

Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.  [3] As time passed, Cain brought an offering to Yahweh from the fruit of the ground.  [4] Abel also brought some of the firstborn of His flock and of its fat. Yahweh respected Abel and His offering,  [5] but he didn’t respect Cain and his offering. Cain was very angry, and the expression on his face fell.  [6] Yahweh said to Cain, “Why are you angry? Why has the expression of your face fallen?  [7] If you do well, won’t it be lifted up? If you don’t do well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire is for you, but you are to rule over it.”  [8] Cain said to Abel, his brother, “Let’s go into the field.” While they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him.\n     [9] Yahweh said to Cain, “Where is Abel, your brother?”\n    He said, “I don’t know. Am I my brother’s keeper?”\n     [10] Yahweh said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood cries to me from the ground.  [11] Now you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.  [12] From now on, when you till the ground, it won’t yield its strength to you. You will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth.”\n     [13] Cain said to Yahweh, “My punishment is greater than I can bear.  [14] Behold, you have driven me out today from the surface of the ground. I will be hidden from your face, and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. Whoever finds me will kill me.”\n     [15] Yahweh said to Him, “Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will be taken on Him sevenfold.” Yahweh appointed a sign for Cain, so that anyone finding Him would not strike Him.\n     [16] Cain left Yahweh’s presence, and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.  [17] Cain knew his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Enoch. He built a city, and named the city after the name of his son, Enoch.  [18] Irad was born to Enoch. Irad became the father of Mehujael. Mehujael became the father of Methushael. Methushael became the father of Lamech.  [19] Lamech took two wives: the name of the first one was Adah, and the name of the second one was Zillah.  [20] Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.  [21] His brother’s name was Jubal, who was the father of all who handle the harp and pipe.  [22] Zillah also gave birth to Tubal Cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of bronze and iron. Tubal Cain’s sister was Naamah.  [23] Lamech said to his wives,\n  “Adah and Zillah, hear my voice.\n    You wives of Lamech, listen to my speech,\n  for I have slain a man for wounding me,\n    a young man for bruising me.\n   [24] If Cain will be avenged seven times,\n    truly Lamech seventy-seven times.”\n     [25] Adam knew His wife again. She gave birth to a son, and named Him Seth, saying, “for God has given me another child instead of Abel, for Cain killed Him.”  [26] A son was also born to Seth, and He named Him Enosh. At that time men began to call on Yahweh’s name.\n"

[2] The fear of you and the dread of you will be on every animal of the earth, and on every bird of the sky. Everything that moves along the ground, and all the fish of the sea, are delivered into your hand.  [3] Every moving thing that lives will be food for you. As I gave you the green herb, I have given everything to you.  [4] But flesh with its life, that is, its blood, you shall not eat.  [5] I will surely require accounting for your life’s blood. At the hand of every animal I will require it. At the hand of man, even at the hand of every man’s brother, I will require the life of man.  [6] Whoever sheds man’s blood, His blood will be shed by man, for God made man in His own image.  [7] Be fruitful and multiply. Increase abundantly in the earth, and multiply in it.”\n     [8] God spoke to Noah and to His sons with Him, saying,  [9] “As for me, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your offspring after you,  [10] and with every living creature that is with you: the birds, the livestock, and every animal of the earth with you, of all that go out of the ship, even every animal of the earth.  [11] I will establish my covenant with you: All flesh will not be cut off any more by the waters of the flood. There will never again be a flood to destroy the earth.”  [12] God said, “This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:  [13] I set my rainbow in the cloud, and it will be a sign of a covenant between me and the earth.  [14] When I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud,  [15] I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh, and the waters will no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.  [16] The rainbow will be in the cloud. I will look at it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.”  [17] God said to Noah, “This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth.”\n     [18] The sons of Noah who went out from the ship were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham is the father of Canaan.  [19] These three were the sons of Noah, and from these the whole earth was populated.\n     [20] Noah began to be a farmer, and planted a vineyard.  [21] He drank of the wine and got drunk. He was uncovered within his tent.  [22] Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside.  [23] Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it on both their shoulders, went in backwards, and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were backwards, and they didn’t see their father’s nakedness.  [24] Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done to him.  [25] He said,\n  “Canaan is cursed.\n    He will be a servant of servants to his brothers.”\n     [26] He said,\n  “Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Shem.\n    Let Canaan be His servant.\n   [27] May God enlarge Japheth.\n    Let Him dwell in the tents of Shem.\n    Let Canaan be His servant.”\n     [28] Noah lived three hundred fifty years after the flood.

Sons were born to them after the flood.\n     [2] The sons of Japheth were: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.  [3] The sons of Gomer were: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.  [4] The sons of Javan were: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.  [5] Of these were the islands of the nations divided in their lands, everyone after his language, after their families, in their nations.\n     [6] The sons of Ham were: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.  [7] The sons of Cush were: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah were: Sheba and Dedan.  [8] Cush became the father of Nimrod. He began to be a mighty one in the earth.  [9] He was a mighty hunter before Yahweh. Therefore it is said, “like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before Yahweh”.  [10] The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.  [11] Out of that land he went into Assyria, and built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah,  [12] and Resen between Nineveh and the great city Calah.  [13] Mizraim became the father of Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,  [14] Pathrusim, Casluhim (which the Philistines descended from), and Caphtorim.\n     [15] Canaan became the father of Sidon (his firstborn), Heth,  [16] the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites,  [17] the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites,  [18] the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Afterward the families of the Canaanites were spread abroad.  [19] The border of the Canaanites was from Sidon—as you go toward Gerar—to Gaza—as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim—to Lasha.  [20] These are the sons of Ham, after their families, according to their languages, in their lands and their nations.\n     [21] Children were also born to Shem (the elder brother of Japheth), the father of all the children of Eber.  [22] The sons of Shem were: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.  [23] The sons of Aram were: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.  [24] Arpachshad became the father of Shelah. Shelah became the father of Eber.  [25] To Eber were born two sons. The name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided. His brother’s name was Joktan.  [26] Joktan became the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,  [27] Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,  [28] Obal, Abimael, Sheba,  [29] Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were the sons of Joktan.  [30] Their dwelling extended from Mesha, as you go toward Sephar, the mountain of the east.  [31] These are the sons of Shem, by their families, according to their languages, lands, and nations.\n     [32] These are the families of the sons of Noah, by their generations, according to their nations. The nations divided from these in the earth after the flood.\n"

[3] They said to one another, “Come, let’s make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.” They had brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar.  [4] They said, “Come, let’s build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top reaches to the sky, and let’s make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of the whole earth.”\n     [5] Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men built.  [6] Yahweh said, “Behold, they are one people, and they all have one language, and this is what they begin to do. Now nothing will be withheld from them, which they intend to do.  [7] Come, let’s go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.”  [8] So Yahweh scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth. They stopped building the city.  [9] Therefore its name was called Babel, because there Yahweh confused the language of all the earth. From there, Yahweh scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth.\n     [10] This is the history of the generations of Shem: Shem was one hundred years old when he became the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood.  [11] Shem lived five hundred years after he became the father of Arpachshad, and became the father of more sons and daughters.\n     [12] Arpachshad lived thirty-five years and became the father of Shelah.  [13] Arpachshad lived four hundred three years after he became the father of Shelah, and became the father of more sons and daughters.\n     [14] Shelah lived thirty years, and became the father of Eber.  [15] Shelah lived four hundred three years after he became the father of Eber, and became the father of more sons and daughters.\n     [16] Eber lived thirty-four years, and became the father of Peleg.  [17] Eber lived four hundred thirty years after he became the father of Peleg, and became the father of more sons and daughters.\n     [18] Peleg lived thirty years, and became the father of Reu.  [19] Peleg lived two hundred nine years after he became the father of Reu, and became the father of more sons and daughters.\n     [20] Reu lived thirty-two years, and became the father of Serug.

[23] Serug lived two hundred years after he became the father of Nahor, and became the father of more sons and daughters.\n     [24] Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and became the father of Terah.  [25] Nahor lived one hundred nineteen years after he became the father of Terah, and became the father of more sons and daughters.\n     [26] Terah lived seventy years, and became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.\n     [27] Now this is the history of the generations of Terah. Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran became the father of Lot.  [28] Haran died in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees, while his father Terah was still alive.  [29] Abram and Nahor married wives. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, who was also the father of Iscah.  [30] Sarai was barren. She had no child.  [31] Terah took Abram his son, Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife. They went from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan. They came to Haran and lived there.  [32] The days of Terah were two hundred five years. Terah died in Haran.\n"

All the families of the earth will be blessed through you.”\n     [4] So Abram went, as Yahweh had told Him. Lot went with Him. Abram was seventy-five years old when He departed from Haran.  [5] Abram took Sarai his wife, Lot his brother’s son, all their possessions that they had gathered, and the people whom they had acquired in Haran, and they went to go into the land of Canaan. They entered into the land of Canaan.  [6] Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time, Canaanites were in the land.\n     [7] Yahweh appeared to Abram and said, “I will give this land to your offspring.”\n    He built an altar there to Yahweh, who had appeared to Him.

[11] When he had come near to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, “See now, I know that you are a beautiful woman to look at.  [12] It will happen that when the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ They will kill me, but they will save you alive.  [13] Please say that you are my sister, that it may be well with me for your sake, and that my soul may live because of you.”\n     [14] When Abram had come into Egypt, Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful.  [15] The princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.  [16] He dealt well with Abram for her sake. He had sheep, cattle, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels.  [17] Yahweh afflicted Pharaoh and His house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife.  [18] Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What is this that you have done to me? Why didn’t you tell me that she was your wife?  [19] Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her to be my wife? Now therefore, see your wife, take her, and go your way.”\n     [20] Pharaoh commanded men concerning him, and they escorted him away with his wife and all that he had.\n"

[6] The land was not able to bear them, that they might live together; for their possessions were so great that they couldn’t live together.  [7] There was strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock. The Canaanites and the Perizzites lived in the land at that time.

[23] Abraham took Ishmael His son, all who were born in His house, and all who were bought with His money: every male among the men of Abraham’s house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the same day, as God had said to Him.  [24] Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.  [25] Ishmael, his son, was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.  [26] In the same day both Abraham and Ishmael, his son, were circumcised.  [27] All the men of his house, those born in the house, and those bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.\n"

[2] He lifted up his eyes and looked, and saw that three men stood near him. When he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth,  [3] and said, “My lord, if now I have found favor in your sight, please don’t go away from your servant.  [4] Now let a little water be fetched, wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.  [5] I will get a piece of bread so you can refresh your heart. After that you may go your way, now that you have come to your servant.”\n    They said, “Very well, do as you have said.”\n     [6] Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, “Quickly prepare three seahs of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.”  [7] Abraham ran to the herd, and fetched a tender and good calf, and gave it to the servant. He hurried to dress it.  [8] He took butter, milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them. He stood by them under the tree, and they ate.\n     [9] They asked him, “Where is Sarah, your wife?”\n    He said, “There, in the tent.”\n     [10] He said, “I will certainly return to you at about this time next year; and behold, Sarah your wife will have a son.”\n    Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.  [11] Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age. Sarah had passed the age of childbearing.  [12] Sarah laughed within herself, saying, “After I have grown old will I have pleasure, my lord being old also?”\n     [13] Yahweh said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh, saying, ‘Will I really bear a child when I am old?’  [14] Is anything too hard for Yahweh? At the set time I will return to you, when the season comes around, and Sarah will have a son.”\n     [15] Then Sarah denied it, saying, “I didn’t laugh,” for she was afraid.\n    He said, “No, but you did laugh.”\n     [16] The men rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom. Abraham went with them to see them on their way.  [17] Yahweh said, “Will I hide from Abraham what I do,  [18] since Abraham will surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him?  [19] For I have known Him, to the end that He may command His children and His household after Him, that they may keep the way of Yahweh, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Yahweh may bring on Abraham that which He has spoken of Him.”  [20] Yahweh said, “Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous,  [21] I will go down now, and see whether their deeds are as bad as the reports which have come to me. If not, I will know.”\n     [22] The men turned from there, and went toward Sodom, but Abraham stood yet before Yahweh.  [23] Abraham came near, and said, “Will you consume the righteous with the wicked?  [24] What if there are fifty righteous within the city? Will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous who are in it?  [25] May it be far from you to do things like that, to kill the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be like the wicked. May that be far from you. Shouldn’t the Judge of all the earth do right?”\n     [26] Yahweh said, “If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare the whole place for their sake.”  [27] Abraham answered, “See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord, although I am dust and ashes.  [28] What if there will lack five of the fifty righteous? Will you destroy all the city for lack of five?”\n    He said, “I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.”\n     [29] He spoke to him yet again, and said, “What if there are forty found there?”\n    He said, “I will not do it for the forty’s sake.”\n     [30] He said, “Oh don’t let the Lord be angry, and I will speak. What if there are thirty found there?”\n    He said, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.”\n     [31] He said, “See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord. What if there are twenty found there?”\n    He said, “I will not destroy it for the twenty’s sake.”\n     [32] He said, “Oh don’t let the Lord be angry, and I will speak just once more. What if ten are found there?”\n    He said, “I will not destroy it for the ten’s sake.”\n     [33] Yahweh went His way as soon as He had finished communing with Abraham, and Abraham returned to His place.\n"

He bowed himself with his face to the earth,  [2] and he said, “See now, my lords, please come into your servant’s house, stay all night, wash your feet, and you can rise up early, and go on your way.”\n    They said, “No, but we will stay in the street all night.”\n     [3] He urged them greatly, and they came in with him, and entered into his house. He made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.  [4] But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter.  [5] They called to Lot, and said to him, “Where are the men who came in to you this night? Bring them out to us, that we may have sex with them.”\n     [6] Lot went out to them through the door, and shut the door after himself.  [7] He said, “Please, my brothers, don’t act so wickedly.  [8] See now, I have two virgin daughters. Please let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them what seems good to you. Only don’t do anything to these men, because they have come under the shadow of my roof.”\n     [9] They said, “Stand back!” Then they said, “This one fellow came in to live as a foreigner, and he appoints himself a judge. Now we will deal worse with you than with them!” They pressed hard on the man Lot, and came near to break the door.  [10] But the men reached out their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut the door.  [11] They struck the men who were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.\n     [12] The men said to Lot, “Do you have anybody else here? Sons-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whomever you have in the city, bring them out of the place:  [13] for we will destroy this place, because the outcry against them has grown so great before Yahweh that Yahweh has sent us to destroy it.”\n     [14] Lot went out, and spoke to His sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry His daughters, and said, “Get up! Get out of this place, for Yahweh will destroy the city!”\n    But He seemed to His sons-in-law to be joking.  [15] When the morning came, then the angels hurried Lot, saying, “Get up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city.”  [16] But He lingered; and the men grabbed His hand, His wife’s hand, and His two daughters’ hands, Yahweh being merciful to Him; and they took Him out, and set Him outside of the city.  [17] It came to pass, when they had taken them out, that he said, “Escape for your life! Don’t look behind you, and don’t stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains, lest you be consumed!”\n     [18] Lot said to them, “Oh, not so, my lord.  [19] See now, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have magnified your loving kindness, which you have shown to me in saving my life. I can’t escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die.  [20] See now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape there (isn’t it a little one?), and my soul will live.”\n     [21] He said to him, “Behold, I have granted your request concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken.  [22] Hurry, escape there, for I can’t do anything until you get there.” Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.\n     [23] The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar.  [24] Then Yahweh rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulfur and fire from Yahweh out of the sky.  [25] He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground.  [26] But Lot’s wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.\n     [27] Abraham went up early in the morning to the place where He had stood before Yahweh.  [28] He looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.\n     [29] When God destroyed the cities of the plain, God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the middle of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot lived.\n     [30] Lot went up out of Zoar, and lived in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he was afraid to live in Zoar. He lived in a cave with his two daughters.  [31] The firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us in the way of all the earth.  [32] Come, let’s make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve our father’s family line.”  [33] They made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father. He didn’t know when she lay down, nor when she arose.  [34] It came to pass on the next day, that the firstborn said to the younger, “Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let’s make him drink wine again tonight. You go in, and lie with him, that we may preserve our father’s family line.”  [35] They made their father drink wine that night also. The younger went and lay with him. He didn’t know when she lay down, nor when she got up.  [36] Thus both of Lot’s daughters were with child by their father.  [37] The firstborn bore a son, and named him Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day.  [38] The younger also bore a son, and called his name Ben Ammi. He is the father of the children of Ammon to this day.\n"

[2] Abraham said about Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.  [3] But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to Him, “Behold, you are a dead man, because of the woman whom you have taken; for she is a man’s wife.”\n     [4] Now Abimelech had not come near her. He said, “Lord, will you kill even a righteous nation?  [5] Didn’t he tell me, ‘She is my sister’? She, even she herself, said, ‘He is my brother.’ I have done this in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands.”\n     [6] God said to Him in the dream, “Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also withheld you from sinning against me. Therefore I didn’t allow you to touch her.  [7] Now therefore, restore the man’s wife. For he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live. If you don’t restore her, know for sure that you will die, you, and all who are yours.”\n     [8] Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ear. The men were very scared.  [9] Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, “What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done!”  [10] Abimelech said to Abraham, “What did you see, that you have done this thing?”\n     [11] Abraham said, “Because I thought, ‘Surely the fear of God is not in this place. They will kill me for my wife’s sake.’  [12] Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.  [13] When God caused me to wander from my father’s house, I said to her, ‘This is your kindness which you shall show to me. Everywhere that we go, say of me, “He is my brother.”’”\n     [14] Abimelech took sheep and cattle, male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored Sarah, his wife, to him.  [15] Abimelech said, “Behold, my land is before you. Dwell where it pleases you.”  [16] To Sarah he said, “Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes to all that are with you. In front of all you are vindicated.”\n     [17] Abraham prayed to God. So God healed Abimelech, His wife, and His female servants, and they bore children.  [18] For Yahweh had closed up tight all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife.\n"

[2] Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in His old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to Him.  [3] Abraham called his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.  [4] Abraham circumcised His son, Isaac, when He was eight days old, as God had commanded Him.  [5] Abraham was one hundred years old when his son, Isaac, was born to him.  [6] Sarah said, “God has made me laugh. Everyone who hears will laugh with me.”  [7] She said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? For I have borne him a son in his old age.”\n     [8] The child grew and was weaned. Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.  [9] Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking.  [10] Therefore she said to Abraham, “Cast out this servant and her son! For the son of this servant will not be heir with my son, Isaac.”\n     [11] The thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight on account of his son.  [12] God said to Abraham, “Don’t let it be grievous in your sight because of the boy, and because of your servant. In all that Sarah says to you, listen to her voice. For your offspring will be named through Isaac.  [13] I will also make a nation of the son of the servant, because he is your child.”  [14] Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a container of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder; and gave her the child, and sent her away. She departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.  [15] The water in the container was spent, and she put the child under one of the shrubs.  [16] She went and sat down opposite him, a good way off, about a bow shot away. For she said, “Don’t let me see the death of the child.” She sat opposite him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.  [17] God heard the voice of the boy.\n    The angel of God called to Hagar out of the sky, and said to her, “What troubles you, Hagar? Don’t be afraid. For God has heard the voice of the boy where He is.  [18] Get up, lift up the boy, and hold him with your hand. For I will make him a great nation.”\n     [19] God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. She went, filled the container with water, and gave the boy a drink.\n     [20] God was with the boy, and He grew. He lived in the wilderness, and as He grew up, He became an archer.  [21] He lived in the wilderness of Paran. His mother got a wife for him out of the land of Egypt.\n     [22] At that time, Abimelech and Phicol the captain of His army spoke to Abraham, saying, “God is with you in all that you do.  [23] Now, therefore, swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son. But according to the kindness that I have done to you, you shall do to me, and to the land in which you have lived as a foreigner.”\n     [24] Abraham said, “I will swear.”  [25] Abraham complained to Abimelech because of a water well, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away.  [26] Abimelech said, “I don’t know who has done this thing. You didn’t tell me, and I didn’t hear of it until today.”\n     [27] Abraham took sheep and cattle, and gave them to Abimelech. Those two made a covenant.  [28] Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.  [29] Abimelech said to Abraham, “What do these seven ewe lambs, which you have set by themselves, mean?”\n     [30] He said, “You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand, that it may be a witness to me, that I have dug this well.”  [31] Therefore he called that place Beersheba, because they both swore an oath there.  [32] So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Abimelech rose up with Phicol, the captain of his army, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.  [33] Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there He called on the name of Yahweh, the Everlasting God.  [34] Abraham lived as a foreigner in the land of the Philistines many days.\n"

Offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of.”\n     [3] Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled His donkey; and took two of His young men with Him, and Isaac His son. He split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went to the place of which God had told Him.  [4] On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place far off.  [5] Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go over there. We will worship, and come back to you.”  [6] Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. He took in his hand the fire and the knife. They both went together.  [7] Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, “My father?”\n    He said, “Here I am, my son.”\n    He said, “Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?”\n     [8] Abraham said, “God will provide Himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” So they both went together.

For now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.”\n     [13] Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son.  [14] Abraham called the name of that place “Yahweh Will Provide”.

Your offspring will possess the gate of his enemies.  [18] All the nations of the earth will be blessed by your offspring, because you have obeyed my voice.’”\n     [19] So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba. Abraham lived at Beersheba.\n     [20] After these things, Abraham was told, “Behold, Milcah, she also has borne children to your brother Nahor:  [21] Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,  [22] Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.”  [23] Bethuel became the father of Rebekah.

Give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.”\n     [5] The children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,  [6] “Hear us, my lord. You are a prince of God among us. Bury your dead in the best of our tombs. None of us will withhold from you His tomb. Bury your dead.”\n     [7] Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, to the children of Heth.

For the full price let him sell it to me among you as a possession for a burial place.”\n     [10] Now Ephron was sitting in the middle of the children of Heth.

What is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver between me and you? Therefore bury your dead.”\n     [16] Abraham listened to Ephron. Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the hearing of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the current merchants’ standard.\n     [17] So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all of its borders, were deeded  [18] to Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city.  [19] After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (that is, Hebron), in the land of Canaan.

[17] The servant ran to meet her, and said, “Please give me a drink, a little water from your pitcher.”\n     [18] She said, “Drink, my lord.” She hurried, and let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him a drink.  [19] When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, “I will also draw for your camels, until they have finished drinking.”  [20] She hurried, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.\n     [21] The man looked steadfastly at her, remaining silent, to know whether Yahweh had made His journey prosperous or not.  [22] As the camels had done drinking, the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold,  [23] and said, “Whose daughter are you? Please tell me. Is there room in your father’s house for us to stay?”\n     [24] She said to him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.”  [25] She said moreover to him, “We have both straw and feed enough, and room to lodge in.”\n     [26] The man bowed His head, and worshiped Yahweh.  [27] He said, “Blessed be Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken His loving kindness and His truth toward my master. As for me, Yahweh has led me on the way to the house of my master’s relatives.”\n     [28] The young lady ran, and told her mother’s house about these words.  [29] Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban. Laban ran out to the man, to the spring.  [30] When he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, “This is what the man said to me,” he came to the man. Behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring.  [31] He said, “Come in, you blessed of Yahweh. Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.”\n     [32] The man came into the house, and he unloaded the camels. He gave straw and feed for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.  [33] Food was set before him to eat, but he said, “I will not eat until I have told my message.”\n    Laban said, “Speak on.”\n     [34] He said, “I am Abraham’s servant.  [35] Yahweh has blessed my master greatly. He has become great. Yahweh has given Him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male servants and female servants, and camels and donkeys.  [36] Sarah, my master’s wife, bore a son to my master when she was old. He has given all that he has to him.  [37] My master made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live,  [38] but you shall go to my father’s house, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son.’  [39] I asked my master, ‘What if the woman will not follow me?’  [40] He said to me, ‘Yahweh, before whom I walk, will send His angel with you, and prosper your way. You shall take a wife for my son from my relatives, and of my father’s house.  [41] Then you will be clear from my oath, when you come to my relatives. If they don’t give her to you, you shall be clear from my oath.’  [42] I came today to the spring, and said, ‘Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, if now you do prosper my way which I go—  [43] behold, I am standing by this spring of water. Let it happen, that the maiden who comes out to draw, to whom I will say, “Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink,”  [44] then she tells me, “Drink, and I will also draw for your camels,”—let her be the woman whom Yahweh has appointed for my master’s son.’  [45] Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her pitcher on her shoulder. She went down to the spring, and drew. I said to her, ‘Please let me drink.’  [46] She hurried and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, ‘Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink.’ So I drank, and she also gave the camels a drink.  [47] I asked her, and said, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him.’ I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands.  [48] I bowed my head, and worshiped Yahweh, and blessed Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter for His son.  [49] Now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. If not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.”\n     [50] Then Laban and Bethuel answered, “The thing proceeds from Yahweh. We can’t speak to you bad or good.  [51] Behold, Rebekah is before you. Take her, and go, and let her be your master’s son’s wife, as Yahweh has spoken.”\n     [52] When Abraham’s servant heard their words, He bowed Himself down to the earth to Yahweh.  [53] The servant brought out jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother and her mother.  [54] They ate and drank, he and the men who were with him, and stayed all night. They rose up in the morning, and he said, “Send me away to my master.”\n     [55] Her brother and her mother said, “Let the young lady stay with us a few days, at least ten. After that she will go.”\n     [56] He said to them, “Don’t hinder me, since Yahweh has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master.”\n     [57] They said, “We will call the young lady, and ask her.”  [58] They called Rebekah, and said to her, “Will you go with this man?”\n    She said, “I will go.”\n     [59] They sent away Rebekah, their sister, with her nurse, Abraham’s servant, and his men.  [60] They blessed Rebekah, and said to her, “Our sister, may you be the mother of thousands of ten thousands, and let your offspring possess the gate of those who hate them.”\n     [61] Rebekah arose with her ladies. They rode on the camels, and followed the man. The servant took Rebekah, and went his way.  [62] Isaac came from the way of Beer Lahai Roi, for he lived in the land of the South.  [63] Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening. He lifted up his eyes and looked. Behold, there were camels coming.  [64] Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she got off the camel.  [65] She said to the servant, “Who is the man who is walking in the field to meet us?”\n    The servant said, “It is my master.”\n    She took her veil, and covered herself.  [66] The servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.  [67] Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife. He loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.\n"

[3] Jokshan became the father of Sheba, and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.  [4] The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.  [5] Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac,  [6] but Abraham gave gifts to the sons of Abraham’s concubines. While he still lived, he sent them away from Isaac his son, eastward, to the east country.  [7] These are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived: one hundred seventy-five years.  [8] Abraham gave up his spirit, and died at a good old age, an old man, and full of years, and was gathered to his people.  [9] Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is near Mamre,  [10] the field which Abraham purchased from the children of Heth. Abraham was buried there with Sarah, his wife.  [11] After the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac, His son. Isaac lived by Beer Lahai Roi.\n     [12] Now this is the history of the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s servant, bore to Abraham.  [13] These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to the order of their birth: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,  [14] Mishma, Dumah, Massa,  [15] Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.  [16] These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments: twelve princes, according to their nations.  [17] These are the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred thirty-seven years. He gave up his spirit and died, and was gathered to his people.  [18] They lived from Havilah to Shur that is before Egypt, as you go toward Assyria. He lived opposite all his relatives.\n     [19] This is the history of the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son. Abraham became the father of Isaac.  [20] Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.  [21] Isaac entreated Yahweh for His wife, because she was barren. Yahweh was entreated by Him, and Rebekah His wife conceived.  [22] The children struggled together within her. She said, “If it is like this, why do I live?” She went to inquire of Yahweh.  [23] Yahweh said to her,\n  “Two nations are in your womb.\n  Two peoples will be separated from your body.\n  The one people will be stronger than the other people.\n  The elder will serve the younger.”\n     [24] When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.  [25] The first came out red all over, like a hairy garment. They named him Esau.  [26] After that, his brother came out, and his hand had hold on Esau’s heel. He was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.\n     [27] The boys grew. Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field. Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents.  [28] Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate his venison. Rebekah loved Jacob.  [29] Jacob boiled stew. Esau came in from the field, and he was famished.  [30] Esau said to Jacob, “Please feed me with some of that red stew, for I am famished.” Therefore his name was called Edom.\n     [31] Jacob said, “First, sell me your birthright.”\n     [32] Esau said, “Behold, I am about to die. What good is the birthright to me?”\n     [33] Jacob said, “Swear to me first.”\n    He swore to him. He sold his birthright to Jacob.  [34] Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew. He ate and drank, rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright.\n"

[2] Yahweh appeared to Him, and said, “Don’t go down into Egypt. Live in the land I will tell you about.  [3] Live in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you. For I will give to you, and to your offspring, all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father.  [4] I will multiply your offspring as the stars of the sky, and will give all these lands to your offspring. In your offspring all the nations of the earth will be blessed,  [5] because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my requirements, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.”\n     [6] Isaac lived in Gerar.  [7] The men of the place asked him about his wife. He said, “She is my sister,” for he was afraid to say, “My wife”, lest, he thought, “the men of the place might kill me for Rebekah, because she is beautiful to look at.”  [8] When he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah, his wife.  [9] Abimelech called Isaac, and said, “Behold, surely she is your wife. Why did you say, ‘She is my sister?’”\n    Isaac said to him, “Because I said, ‘Lest I die because of her.’”\n     [10] Abimelech said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us!”\n     [11] Abimelech commanded all the people, saying, “He who touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death.”\n     [12] Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year one hundred times what He planted. Yahweh blessed Him.  [13] The man grew great, and grew more and more until he became very great.  [14] He had possessions of flocks, possessions of herds, and a great household. The Philistines envied him.  [15] Now all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth.  [16] Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us, for you are much mightier than we.”\n     [17] Isaac departed from there, encamped in the valley of Gerar, and lived there.\n     [18] Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father, for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. He called their names after the names by which his father had called them.  [19] Isaac’s servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of flowing water.  [20] The herdsmen of Gerar argued with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, “The water is ours.” So he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.  [21] They dug another well, and they argued over that, also. So he called its name Sitnah.  [22] He left that place, and dug another well. They didn’t argue over that one. So He called it Rehoboth. He said, “For now Yahweh has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land.”\n     [23] He went up from there to Beersheba.  [24] Yahweh appeared to Him the same night, and said, “I am the God of Abraham your father. Don’t be afraid, for I am with you, and will bless you, and multiply your offspring for my servant Abraham’s sake.”\n     [25] He built an altar there, and called on Yahweh’s name, and pitched His tent there. There Isaac’s servants dug a well.\n     [26] Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his army.  [27] Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, since you hate me, and have sent me away from you?”\n     [28] They said, “We saw plainly that Yahweh was with you. We said, ‘Let there now be an oath between us, even between us and you, and let’s make a covenant with you,  [29] that you will do us no harm, as we have not touched you, and as we have done to you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace.’ You are now the blessed of Yahweh.”\n     [30] He made them a feast, and they ate and drank.  [31] They rose up some time in the morning, and swore an oath to one another. Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.  [32] The same day, Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and said to him, “We have found water.”  [33] He called it “Shibah”. Therefore the name of the city is “Beersheba” to this day.\n     [34] When Esau was forty years old, he took as wife Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite.  [35] They grieved Isaac’s and Rebekah’s spirits.\n"

I don’t know the day of my death.  [3] Now therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and get me venison.  [4] Make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat, and that my soul may bless you before I die.”\n     [5] Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.  [6] Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, “Behold, I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying,  [7] ‘Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat, and bless you before Yahweh before my death.’  [8] Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command you.  [9] Go now to the flock and get me two good young goats from there. I will make them savory food for your father, such as he loves.  [10] You shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, so that he may bless you before his death.”\n     [11] Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.  [12] What if my father touches me? I will seem to him as a deceiver, and I would bring a curse on myself, and not a blessing.”\n     [13] His mother said to him, “Let your curse be on me, my son. Only obey my voice, and go get them for me.”\n     [14] He went, and got them, and brought them to his mother. His mother made savory food, such as his father loved.  [15] Rebekah took the good clothes of Esau, her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob, her younger son.  [16] She put the skins of the young goats on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck.  [17] She gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.\n     [18] He came to his father, and said, “My father?”\n    He said, “Here I am. Who are you, my son?”\n     [19] Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn. I have done what you asked me to do. Please arise, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless me.”\n     [20] Isaac said to His son, “How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?”\n    He said, “Because Yahweh your God gave me success.”\n     [21] Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are really my son Esau or not.”\n     [22] Jacob went near to Isaac his father. He felt him, and said, “The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.”  [23] He didn’t recognize him, because his hands were hairy, like his brother Esau’s hands. So he blessed him.  [24] He said, “Are you really my son Esau?”\n    He said, “I am.”\n     [25] He said, “Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless you.”\n    He brought it near to him, and he ate. He brought him wine, and he drank.  [26] His father Isaac said to him, “Come near now, and kiss me, my son.”  [27] He came near, and kissed Him. He smelled the smell of His clothing, and blessed Him, and said,\n  “Behold, the smell of my son\n    is as the smell of a field which Yahweh has blessed.\n   [28] God give you of the dew of the sky,\n    of the fatness of the earth,\n    and plenty of grain and new wine.\n   [29] Let peoples serve you,\n    and nations bow down to you.\n  Be lord over your brothers.\n    Let your mother’s sons bow down to you.\n  Cursed be everyone who curses you.\n    Blessed be everyone who blesses you.”\n     [30] As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting.  [31] He also made savory food, and brought it to his father. He said to his father, “Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s venison, that your soul may bless me.”\n     [32] Isaac his father said to him, “Who are you?”\n    He said, “I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.”\n     [33] Isaac trembled violently, and said, “Who, then, is he who has taken venison, and brought it to me, and I have eaten of all before you came, and have blessed him? Yes, he will be blessed.”\n     [34] When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, “Bless me, even me also, my father.”\n     [35] He said, “Your brother came with deceit, and has taken away your blessing.”\n     [36] He said, “Isn’t he rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright. See, now he has taken away my blessing.” He said, “Haven’t you reserved a blessing for me?”\n     [37] Isaac answered Esau, “Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants. I have sustained him with grain and new wine. What then will I do for you, my son?”\n     [38] Esau said to his father, “Do you have just one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, my father.” Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.\n     [39] Isaac his father answered him,\n  “Behold, your dwelling will be of the fatness of the earth,\n  and of the dew of the sky from above.\n   [40] You will live by your sword, and you will serve your brother.\n  It will happen, when you will break loose,\n  that you will shake his yoke from off your neck.”\n     [41] Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him. Esau said in his heart, “The days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then I will kill my brother Jacob.”\n     [42] The words of Esau, her elder son, were told to Rebekah. She sent and called Jacob, her younger son, and said to him, “Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you.  [43] Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. Arise, flee to Laban, my brother, in Haran.  [44] Stay with him a few days, until your brother’s fury turns away—  [45] until your brother’s anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send, and get you from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?”\n     [46] Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good will my life do me?”\n"

He went to Paddan Aram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob’s and Esau’s mother.\n     [6] Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan Aram, to take him a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him a command, saying, “You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;”  [7] and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan Aram.  [8] Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan didn’t please Isaac, his father.

This is none other than God’s house, and this is the gate of heaven.”\n     [18] Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on its top.

[10] When Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother’s brother, Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother.  [11] Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.  [12] Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s relative, and that he was Rebekah’s son. She ran and told her father.\n     [13] When Laban heard the news of Jacob, his sister’s son, he ran to meet Jacob, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things.  [14] Laban said to him, “Surely you are my bone and my flesh.” Jacob stayed with him for a month.  [15] Laban said to Jacob, “Because you are my relative, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what will your wages be?”\n     [16] Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.  [17] Leah’s eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and attractive.  [18] Jacob loved Rachel. He said, “I will serve you seven years for Rachel, your younger daughter.”\n     [19] Laban said, “It is better that I give her to you, than that I should give her to another man. Stay with me.”\n     [20] Jacob served seven years for Rachel. They seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had for her.\n     [21] Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.”\n     [22] Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.  [23] In the evening, he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to Jacob. He went in to her.  [24] Laban gave Zilpah his servant to his daughter Leah for a servant.  [25] In the morning, behold, it was Leah! He said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Didn’t I serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?”\n     [26] Laban said, “It is not done so in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn.  [27] Fulfill the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me for seven more years.”\n     [28] Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. He gave him Rachel his daughter as wife.  [29] Laban gave Bilhah, his servant, to his daughter Rachel to be her servant.  [30] He went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him seven more years.\n     [31] Yahweh saw that Leah was hated, and He opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.  [32] Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she named Him Reuben. For she said, “Because Yahweh has looked at my affliction; for now my husband will love me.”  [33] She conceived again, and bore a son, and said, “Because Yahweh has heard that I am hated, He has therefore given me this son also.” She named Him Simeon.  [34] She conceived again, and bore a son. She said, “Now this time my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons.” Therefore his name was called Levi.  [35] She conceived again, and bore a son. She said, “This time I will praise Yahweh.” Therefore she named Him Judah. Then she stopped bearing.\n"

She said to Jacob, “Give me children, or else I will die.”\n     [2] Jacob’s anger burned against Rachel, and He said, “Am I in God’s place, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?”\n     [3] She said, “Behold, my maid Bilhah. Go in to her, that she may bear on my knees, and I also may obtain children by her.”  [4] She gave him Bilhah her servant as wife, and Jacob went in to her.  [5] Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son.  [6] Rachel said, “God has judged me, and has also heard my voice, and has given me a son.” Therefore she called His name Dan.  [7] Bilhah, Rachel’s servant, conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son.  [8] Rachel said, “I have wrestled with my sister with mighty wrestlings, and have prevailed.” She named him Naphtali.\n     [9] When Leah saw that she had finished bearing, she took Zilpah, her servant, and gave her to Jacob as a wife.  [10] Zilpah, Leah’s servant, bore Jacob a son.  [11] Leah said, “How fortunate!” She named him Gad.  [12] Zilpah, Leah’s servant, bore Jacob a second son.  [13] Leah said, “Happy am I, for the daughters will call me happy.” She named him Asher.\n     [14] Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother, Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”\n     [15] Leah said to her, “Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son’s mandrakes, also?”\n    Rachel said, “Therefore he will lie with you tonight for your son’s mandrakes.”\n     [16] Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, “You must come in to me; for I have surely hired you with my son’s mandrakes.”\n    He lay with her that night.  [17] God listened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob a fifth son.  [18] Leah said, “God has given me my hire, because I gave my servant to my husband.” She named Him Issachar.  [19] Leah conceived again, and bore a sixth son to Jacob.  [20] Leah said, “God has endowed me with a good dowry. Now my husband will live with me, because I have borne Him six sons.” She named Him Zebulun.  [21] Afterwards, she bore a daughter, and named her Dinah.\n     [22] God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her, and opened her womb.  [23] She conceived, bore a son, and said, “God has taken away my reproach.”  [24] She named Him Joseph, saying, “May Yahweh add another son to me.”\n     [25] When Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country.  [26] Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know my service with which I have served you.”\n     [27] Laban said to Him, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, stay here, for I have divined that Yahweh has blessed me for your sake.”  [28] He said, “Appoint me your wages, and I will give it.”\n     [29] Jacob said to him, “You know how I have served you, and how your livestock have fared with me.  [30] For it was little which you had before I came, and it has increased to a multitude. Yahweh has blessed you wherever I turned. Now when will I provide for my own house also?”\n     [31] Laban said, “What shall I give you?”\n    Jacob said, “You shall not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed your flock and keep it.  [32] I will pass through all your flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats. This will be my hire.  [33] So my righteousness will answer for me hereafter, when you come concerning my hire that is before you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that might be with me, will be considered stolen.”\n     [34] Laban said, “Behold, let it be according to your word.”\n     [35] That day, he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.  [36] He set three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.\n     [37] Jacob took to himself rods of fresh poplar, almond, and plane tree, peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.  [38] He set the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink. They conceived when they came to drink.  [39] The flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks produced streaked, speckled, and spotted.  [40] Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the black in Laban’s flock. He put his own droves apart, and didn’t put them into Laban’s flock.  [41] Whenever the stronger of the flock conceived, Jacob laid the rods in front of the eyes of the flock in the watering troughs, that they might conceive among the rods;  [42] but when the flock were feeble, he didn’t put them in. So the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s.  [43] The man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.\n"

He has obtained all this wealth from that which was our father’s.”  [2] Jacob saw the expression on Laban’s face, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.  [3] Yahweh said to Jacob, “Return to the land of your fathers, and to your relatives, and I will be with you.”\n     [4] Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock,  [5] and said to them, “I see the expression on your father’s face, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me.  [6] You know that I have served your father with all of my strength.  [7] Your father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times, but God didn’t allow Him to hurt me.  [8] If he said, ‘The speckled will be your wages,’ then all the flock bore speckled. If he said, ‘The streaked will be your wages,’ then all the flock bore streaked.  [9] Thus God has taken away your father’s livestock, and given them to me.  [10] During mating season, I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold, the male goats which leaped on the flock were streaked, speckled, and grizzled.  [11] The angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob,’ and I said, ‘Here I am.’  [12] He said, ‘Now lift up your eyes, and behold, all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked, speckled, and grizzled, for I have seen all that Laban does to you.  [13] I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you vowed a vow to me. Now arise, get out from this land, and return to the land of your birth.’”\n     [14] Rachel and Leah answered him, “Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house?  [15] Aren’t we considered as foreigners by him? For he has sold us, and has also used up our money.  [16] For all the riches which God has taken away from our father are ours and our children’s. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do.”\n     [17] Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives on the camels,  [18] and he took away all his livestock, and all his possessions which he had gathered, including the livestock which he had gained in Paddan Aram, to go to Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan.  [19] Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep; and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father’s.\n     [20] Jacob deceived Laban the Syrian, in that he didn’t tell him that he was running away.  [21] So he fled with all that he had. He rose up, passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.\n     [22] Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled.  [23] He took his relatives with him, and pursued him seven days’ journey. He overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.  [24] God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night, and said to Him, “Be careful that you don’t speak to Jacob either good or bad.”\n     [25] Laban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain, and Laban with his relatives encamped in the mountain of Gilead.  [26] Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done, that you have deceived me, and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword?  [27] Why did you flee secretly, and deceive me, and didn’t tell me, that I might have sent you away with mirth and with songs, with tambourine and with harp;  [28] and didn’t allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now have you done foolishly.  [29] It is in the power of my hand to hurt you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, ‘Be careful that you don’t speak to Jacob either good or bad.’  [30] Now, you want to be gone, because you greatly longed for your father’s house, but why have you stolen my gods?”\n     [31] Jacob answered Laban, “Because I was afraid, for I said, ‘Lest you should take your daughters from me by force.’  [32] Anyone you find your gods with shall not live. Before our relatives, discern what is yours with me, and take it.” For Jacob didn’t know that Rachel had stolen them.\n     [33] Laban went into Jacob’s tent, into Leah’s tent, and into the tent of the two female servants; but he didn’t find them. He went out of Leah’s tent, and entered into Rachel’s tent.  [34] Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, put them in the camel’s saddle, and sat on them. Laban felt around all the tent, but didn’t find them.  [35] She said to her father, “Don’t let my lord be angry that I can’t rise up before you; for I’m having my period.” He searched, but didn’t find the teraphim.\n     [36] Jacob was angry, and argued with Laban. Jacob answered Laban, “What is my trespass? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me?  [37] Now that you have felt around in all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? Set it here before my relatives and your relatives, that they may judge between us two.\n     [38] “These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not cast their young, and I haven’t eaten the rams of your flocks.  [39] That which was torn of animals, I didn’t bring to you. I bore its loss. Of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.  [40] This was my situation: in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from my eyes.  [41] These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.  [42] Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night.”\n     [43] Laban answered Jacob, “The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine! What can I do today to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne?  [44] Now come, let’s make a covenant, you and I. Let it be for a witness between me and you.”\n     [45] Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.  [46] Jacob said to his relatives, “Gather stones.” They took stones, and made a heap. They ate there by the heap.  [47] Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.  [48] Laban said, “This heap is witness between me and you today.” Therefore it was named Galeed  [49] and Mizpah, for He said, “Yahweh watch between me and you, when we are absent one from another.  [50] If you afflict my daughters, or if you take wives in addition to my daughters, no man is with us; behold, God is witness between me and you.”  [51] Laban said to Jacob, “See this heap, and see the pillar, which I have set between me and you.  [52] May this heap be a witness, and the pillar be a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.  [53] The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.” Then Jacob swore by the fear of His father, Isaac.  [54] Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his relatives to eat bread. They ate bread, and stayed all night in the mountain.  [55] Early in the morning, Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them. Laban departed and returned to his place.\n"

[2] When He saw them, Jacob said, “This is God’s army.” He called the name of that place Mahanaim.\n     [3] Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau, his brother, to the land of Seir, the field of Edom.  [4] He commanded them, saying, “This is what you shall tell my lord, Esau: ‘This is what your servant, Jacob, says. I have lived as a foreigner with Laban, and stayed until now.  [5] I have cattle, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your sight.’”  [6] The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We came to your brother Esau. He is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.”  [7] Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed. He divided the people who were with him, along with the flocks, the herds, and the camels, into two companies.  [8] He said, “If Esau comes to the one company, and strikes it, then the company which is left will escape.”  [9] Jacob said, “God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, Yahweh, who said to me, ‘Return to your country, and to your relatives, and I will do you good,’  [10] I am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses, and of all the truth, which you have shown to your servant; for with just my staff I crossed over this Jordan; and now I have become two companies.  [11] Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and strike me and the mothers with the children.  [12] You said, ‘I will surely do you good, and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which can’t be counted because there are so many.’”\n     [13] He stayed there that night, and took from that which he had with him a present for Esau, his brother:  [14] two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,  [15] thirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals.  [16] He delivered them into the hands of his servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants, “Pass over before me, and put a space between herd and herd.”  [17] He commanded the foremost, saying, “When Esau, my brother, meets you, and asks you, saying, ‘Whose are you? Where are you going? Whose are these before you?’  [18] Then you shall say, ‘They are your servant, Jacob’s. It is a present sent to my lord, Esau. Behold, he also is behind us.’”  [19] He commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the herds, saying, “This is how you shall speak to Esau, when you find him.  [20] You shall say, ‘Not only that, but behold, your servant, Jacob, is behind us.’” For, he said, “I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.”\n     [21] So the present passed over before him, and he himself stayed that night in the camp.\n     [22] He rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two servants, and his eleven sons, and crossed over the ford of the Jabbok.  [23] He took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.  [24] Jacob was left alone, and wrestled with a man there until the breaking of the day.  [25] When he saw that he didn’t prevail against him, the man touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was strained as he wrestled.  [26] The man said, “Let me go, for the day breaks.”\n    Jacob said, “I won’t let you go unless you bless me.”\n     [27] He said to him, “What is your name?”\n    He said, “Jacob”.\n     [28] He said, “Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have fought with God and with men, and have prevailed.”\n     [29] Jacob asked him, “Please tell me your name.”\n    He said, “Why is it that you ask what my name is?” So he blessed him there.\n     [30] Jacob called the name of the place Peniel; for He said, “I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.”  [31] The sun rose on him as he passed over Peniel, and he limped because of his thigh.  [32] Therefore the children of Israel don’t eat the sinew of the hip, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew of the hip.\n"

[3] He himself passed over in front of them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.\n     [4] Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, fell on his neck, kissed him, and they wept.  [5] He lifted up His eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, “Who are these with you?”\n    He said, “The children whom God has graciously given your servant.”  [6] Then the servants came near with their children, and they bowed themselves.  [7] Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves. After them, Joseph came near with Rachel, and they bowed themselves.\n     [8] Esau said, “What do you mean by all this company which I met?”\n    Jacob said, “To find favor in the sight of my lord.”\n     [9] Esau said, “I have enough, my brother; let that which you have be yours.”\n     [10] Jacob said, “Please, no, if I have now found favor in your sight, then receive my present at my hand, because I have seen your face, as one sees the face of God, and you were pleased with me.

[2] Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her. He took her, lay with her, and humbled her.  [3] His soul joined to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young lady, and spoke kindly to the young lady.  [4] Shechem spoke to his father, Hamor, saying, “Get me this young lady as a wife.”\n     [5] Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah, his daughter; and his sons were with his livestock in the field. Jacob held his peace until they came.  [6] Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to talk with him.  [7] The sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it. The men were grieved, and they were very angry, because he had done folly in Israel in lying with Jacob’s daughter, a thing that ought not to be done.  [8] Hamor talked with them, saying, “The soul of my son, Shechem, longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife.  [9] Make marriages with us. Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves.  [10] You shall dwell with us, and the land will be before you. Live and trade in it, and get possessions in it.”\n     [11] Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, “Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you will tell me I will give.  [12] Ask me a great amount for a dowry, and I will give whatever you ask of me, but give me the young lady as a wife.”\n     [13] The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with deceit when they spoke, because he had defiled Dinah their sister,  [14] and said to them, “We can’t do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised; for that is a reproach to us.  [15] Only on this condition will we consent to you. If you will be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised,  [16] then will we give our daughters to you; and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.  [17] But if you will not listen to us and be circumcised, then we will take our sister, and we will be gone.”\n     [18] Their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor’s son.  [19] The young man didn’t wait to do this thing, because he had delight in Jacob’s daughter, and he was honored above all the house of his father.  [20] Hamor and Shechem, his son, came to the gate of their city, and talked with the men of their city, saying,  [21] “These men are peaceful with us. Therefore let them live in the land and trade in it. For behold, the land is large enough for them. Let’s take their daughters to us for wives, and let’s give them our daughters.  [22] Only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us, to become one people, if every male among us is circumcised, as they are circumcised.  [23] Won’t their livestock and their possessions and all their animals be ours? Only let’s give our consent to them, and they will dwell with us.”\n     [24] All who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor, and to Shechem his son; and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.  [25] On the third day, when they were sore, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, each took his sword, came upon the unsuspecting city, and killed all the males.  [26] They killed Hamor and Shechem, his son, with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went away.  [27] Jacob’s sons came on the dead, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.  [28] They took their flocks, their herds, their donkeys, that which was in the city, that which was in the field,  [29] and all their wealth. They took captive all their little ones and their wives, and took as plunder everything that was in the house.  [30] Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites. I am few in number. They will gather themselves together against me and strike me, and I will be destroyed, I and my house.”\n     [31] They said, “Should he deal with our sister as with a prostitute?”\n"

Make there an altar to God, who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother.”\n     [2] Then Jacob said to his household, and to all who were with him, “Put away the foreign gods that are among you, purify yourselves, and change your garments.  [3] Let’s arise, and go up to Bethel. I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me on the way which I went.”\n     [4] They gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.  [5] They traveled, and a terror of God was on the cities that were around them, and they didn’t pursue the sons of Jacob.  [6] So Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him.  [7] He built an altar there, and called the place El Beth El; because there God was revealed to Him, when He fled from the face of His brother.  [8] Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the oak; and its name was called Allon Bacuth.\n     [9] God appeared to Jacob again, when He came from Paddan Aram, and blessed Him.  [10] God said to Him, “Your name is Jacob. Your name shall not be Jacob any more, but your name will be Israel.” He named Him Israel.  [11] God said to Him, “I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations will be from you, and kings will come out of your body.  [12] The land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give it to you, and to your offspring after you I will give the land.”\n     [13] God went up from Him in the place where He spoke with Him.  [14] Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him, a pillar of stone. He poured out a drink offering on it, and poured oil on it.  [15] Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with Him “Bethel”.\n     [16] They traveled from Bethel. There was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and Rachel travailed. She had hard labor.  [17] When she was in hard labor, the midwife said to her, “Don’t be afraid, for now you will have another son.”\n     [18] As her soul was departing (for she died), she named him Benoni, but his father named him Benjamin.  [19] Rachel died, and was buried on the way to Ephrath (also called Bethlehem).  [20] Jacob set up a pillar on her grave. The same is the Pillar of Rachel’s grave to this day.  [21] Israel traveled, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder.  [22] While Israel lived in that land, Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father’s concubine, and Israel heard of it.\n    Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.  [23] The sons of Leah: Reuben (Jacob’s firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.  [24] The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.  [25] The sons of Bilhah (Rachel’s servant): Dan and Naphtali.  [26] The sons of Zilpah (Leah’s servant): Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan Aram.  [27] Jacob came to Isaac his father, to Mamre, to Kiriath Arba (which is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac lived as foreigners.\n     [28] The days of Isaac were one hundred eighty years.  [29] Isaac gave up the spirit and died, and was gathered to his people, old and full of days. Esau and Jacob, his sons, buried him.\n"

Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers. He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father’s wives. Joseph brought an evil report of them to their father.  [3] Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age, and he made him a tunic of many colors.  [4] His brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, and they hated him, and couldn’t speak peaceably to him.\n     [5] Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brothers, and they hated him all the more.  [6] He said to them, “Please hear this dream which I have dreamed:  [7] for behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and also stood upright; and behold, your sheaves came around, and bowed down to my sheaf.”\n     [8] His brothers asked him, “Will you indeed reign over us? Will you indeed have dominion over us?” They hated him all the more for his dreams and for his words.  [9] He dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, “Behold, I have dreamed yet another dream: and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me.”  [10] He told it to his father and to his brothers. His father rebuked him, and said to him, “What is this dream that you have dreamed? Will I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves down to the earth before you?”  [11] His brothers envied him, but his father kept this saying in mind.\n     [12] His brothers went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem.  [13] Israel said to Joseph, “Aren’t your brothers feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send you to them.” He said to him, “Here I am.”\n     [14] He said to him, “Go now, see whether it is well with your brothers, and well with the flock; and bring me word again.” So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.  [15] A certain man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the field. The man asked him, “What are you looking for?”\n     [16] He said, “I am looking for my brothers. Tell me, please, where they are feeding the flock.”\n     [17] The man said, “They have left here, for I heard them say, ‘Let’s go to Dothan.’”\n    Joseph went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan.  [18] They saw him afar off, and before he came near to them, they conspired against him to kill him.  [19] They said to one another, “Behold, this dreamer comes.  [20] Come now therefore, and let’s kill him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, ‘An evil animal has devoured him.’ We will see what will become of his dreams.”\n     [21] Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand, and said, “Let’s not take his life.”  [22] Reuben said to them, “Shed no blood. Throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand on him”—that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his father.  [23] When Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the tunic of many colors that was on him;  [24] and they took him, and threw him into the pit. The pit was empty. There was no water in it.\n     [25] They sat down to eat bread, and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.  [26] Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?  [27] Come, and let’s sell him to the Ishmaelites, and not let our hand be on him; for he is our brother, our flesh.” His brothers listened to him.  [28] Midianites who were merchants passed by, and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. The merchants brought Joseph into Egypt.\n     [29] Reuben returned to the pit, and saw that Joseph wasn’t in the pit; and he tore his clothes.  [30] He returned to his brothers, and said, “The child is no more; and I, where will I go?”  [31] They took Joseph’s tunic, and killed a male goat, and dipped the tunic in the blood.  [32] They took the tunic of many colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, “We have found this. Examine it, now, and see if it is your son’s tunic or not.”\n     [33] He recognized it, and said, “It is my son’s tunic. An evil animal has devoured him. Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces.”  [34] Jacob tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his waist, and mourned for his son many days.  [35] All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. He said, “For I will go down to Sheol to my son, mourning.” His father wept for him.  [36] The Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard.\n"

[2] There, Judah saw the daughter of a certain Canaanite man named Shua. He took her, and went in to her.  [3] She conceived, and bore a son; and he named him Er.  [4] She conceived again, and bore a son; and she named him Onan.  [5] She yet again bore a son, and named him Shelah. He was at Chezib when she bore him.  [6] Judah took a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.  [7] Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in Yahweh’s sight. So Yahweh killed Him.  [8] Judah said to Onan, “Go in to your brother’s wife, and perform the duty of a husband’s brother to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.”  [9] Onan knew that the offspring wouldn’t be his; and when he went in to his brother’s wife, he spilled his semen on the ground, lest he should give offspring to his brother.  [10] The thing which He did was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and He killed Him also.  [11] Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, “Remain a widow in your father’s house, until Shelah, my son, is grown up;” for he said, “Lest he also die, like his brothers.” Tamar went and lived in her father’s house.\n     [12] After many days, Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died. Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheep shearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah, the Adullamite.  [13] Tamar was told, “Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.”  [14] She took off the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is on the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she wasn’t given to him as a wife.  [15] When Judah saw her, he thought that she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face.  [16] He turned to her by the way, and said, “Please come, let me come in to you,” for he didn’t know that she was his daughter-in-law.\n    She said, “What will you give me, that you may come in to me?”\n     [17] He said, “I will send you a young goat from the flock.”\n    She said, “Will you give me a pledge, until you send it?”\n     [18] He said, “What pledge will I give you?”\n    She said, “Your signet and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand.”\n    He gave them to her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him.  [19] She arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.  [20] Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend, the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman’s hand, but he didn’t find her.  [21] Then he asked the men of her place, saying, “Where is the prostitute, that was at Enaim by the road?”\n    They said, “There has been no prostitute here.”\n     [22] He returned to Judah, and said, “I haven’t found her; and also the men of the place said, ‘There has been no prostitute here.’”  [23] Judah said, “Let her keep it, lest we be shamed. Behold, I sent this young goat, and you haven’t found her.”\n     [24] About three months later, Judah was told, “Tamar, your daughter-in-law, has played the prostitute. Moreover, behold, she is with child by prostitution.”\n    Judah said, “Bring her out, and let her be burned.”  [25] When she was brought out, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, “I am with child by the man who owns these.” She also said, “Please discern whose these are—the signet, and the cords, and the staff.”\n     [26] Judah acknowledged them, and said, “She is more righteous than I, because I didn’t give her to Shelah, my son.”\n    He knew her again no more.  [27] In the time of her travail, behold, twins were in her womb.  [28] When she travailed, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, “This came out first.”  [29] As he drew back his hand, behold, his brother came out, and she said, “Why have you made a breach for yourself?” Therefore his name was called Perez.  [30] Afterward his brother came out, who had the scarlet thread on his hand, and his name was called Zerah.\n"

I have heard it said of you, that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.”\n     [16] Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, “It isn’t in me. God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.”\n     [17] Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, “In my dream, behold, I stood on the brink of the river;  [18] and behold, seven fat and sleek cattle came up out of the river. They fed in the marsh grass;  [19] and behold, seven other cattle came up after them, poor and very ugly and thin, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for ugliness.  [20] The thin and ugly cattle ate up the first seven fat cattle;  [21] and when they had eaten them up, it couldn’t be known that they had eaten them, but they were still ugly, as at the beginning. So I awoke.  [22] I saw in my dream, and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, full and good;  [23] and behold, seven heads of grain, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.  [24] The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads of grain. I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.”\n     [25] Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dream of Pharaoh is one. What God is about to do He has declared to Pharaoh.  [26] The seven good cattle are seven years; and the seven good heads of grain are seven years. The dream is one.  [27] The seven thin and ugly cattle that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty heads of grain blasted with the east wind; they will be seven years of famine.  [28] That is the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh. God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do.  [29] Behold, seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt are coming.  [30] Seven years of famine will arise after them, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume the land,  [31] and the plenty will not be known in the land by reason of that famine which follows; for it will be very grievous.  [32] The dream was doubled to Pharaoh, because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.\n     [33] “Now therefore let Pharaoh look for a discreet and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt.  [34] Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt’s produce in the seven plenteous years.  [35] Let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and store grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.  [36] The food will be to supply the land against the seven years of famine, which will be in the land of Egypt; so that the land will not perish through the famine.”\n     [37] The thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.  [38] Pharaoh said to His servants, “Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?”  [39] Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Because God has shown you all of this, there is no one so discreet and wise as you.  [40] You shall be over my house. All my people will be ruled according to your word. Only in the throne I will be greater than you.”  [41] Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.”  [42] Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it on Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in robes of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck.  [43] He made him ride in the second chariot which he had. They cried before him, “Bow the knee!” He set him over all the land of Egypt.  [44] Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh. Without you, no man shall lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.”  [45] Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphenath-Paneah. He gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On as a wife. Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.\n     [46] Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.  [47] In the seven plenteous years the earth produced abundantly.  [48] He gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities. He stored food in each city from the fields around that city.  [49] Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he stopped counting, for it was without number.  [50] To Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him.  [51] Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh, “For”, He said, “God has made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.”  [52] The name of the second, He called Ephraim: “For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.”\n     [53] The seven years of plenty, that were in the land of Egypt, came to an end.  [54] The seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.  [55] When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread, and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph. What he says to you, do.”  [56] The famine was over all the surface of the earth. Joseph opened all the store houses, and sold to the Egyptians. The famine was severe in the land of Egypt.  [57] All countries came into Egypt, to Joseph, to buy grain, because the famine was severe in all the earth.\n"

Go down there, and buy for us from there, so that we may live, and not die.”  [3] Joseph’s ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.  [4] But Jacob didn’t send Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, with his brothers; for he said, “Lest perhaps harm happen to him.”  [5] The sons of Israel came to buy among those who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.  [6] Joseph was the governor over the land. It was he who sold to all the people of the land. Joseph’s brothers came, and bowed themselves down to him with their faces to the earth.  [7] Joseph saw his brothers, and he recognized them, but acted like a stranger to them, and spoke roughly with them. He said to them, “Where did you come from?”\n    They said, “From the land of Canaan, to buy food.”\n     [8] Joseph recognized his brothers, but they didn’t recognize him.  [9] Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed about them, and said to them, “You are spies! You have come to see the nakedness of the land.”\n     [10] They said to him, “No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food.  [11] We are all one man’s sons; we are honest men. Your servants are not spies.”\n     [12] He said to them, “No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land!”\n     [13] They said, “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is today with our father, and one is no more.”\n     [14] Joseph said to them, “It is like I told you, saying, ‘You are spies!’  [15] By this you shall be tested. By the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go out from here, unless your youngest brother comes here.  [16] Send one of you, and let him get your brother, and you shall be bound, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you, or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies.”  [17] He put them all together into custody for three days.\n     [18] Joseph said to them the third day, “Do this, and live, for I fear God.  [19] If you are honest men, then let one of your brothers be bound in your prison; but you go, carry grain for the famine of your houses.  [20] Bring your youngest brother to me; so will your words be verified, and you won’t die.”\n    They did so.  [21] They said to one another, “We are certainly guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us, and we wouldn’t listen. Therefore this distress has come upon us.”  [22] Reuben answered them, saying, “Didn’t I tell you, saying, ‘Don’t sin against the child,’ and you wouldn’t listen? Therefore also, behold, his blood is required.”  [23] They didn’t know that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them.  [24] He turned himself away from them, and wept. Then he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes.  [25] Then Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with grain, and to restore each man’s money into his sack, and to give them food for the way. So it was done to them.\n     [26] They loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed from there.  [27] As one of them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the lodging place, he saw his money. Behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.  [28] He said to His brothers, “My money is restored! Behold, it is in my sack!” Their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, “What is this that God has done to us?”  [29] They came to Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan, and told him all that had happened to them, saying,  [30] “The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.  [31] We said to him, ‘We are honest men. We are no spies.  [32] We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no more, and the youngest is today with our father in the land of Canaan.’  [33] The man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘By this I will know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your houses, and go your way.  [34] Bring your youngest brother to me. Then I will know that you are not spies, but that you are honest men. So I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall trade in the land.’”\n     [35] As they emptied their sacks, behold, each man’s bundle of money was in his sack. When they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.  [36] Jacob, their father, said to them, “You have bereaved me of my children! Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more, and you want to take Benjamin away. All these things are against me.”\n     [37] Reuben spoke to his father, saying, “Kill my two sons, if I don’t bring him to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him to you again.”\n     [38] He said, “My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left. If harm happens to him along the way in which you go, then you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.”\n"

[2] When they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said to them, “Go again, buy us a little more food.”\n     [3] Judah spoke to him, saying, “The man solemnly warned us, saying, ‘You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.’  [4] If you’ll send our brother with us, we’ll go down and buy you food;  [5] but if you don’t send him, we won’t go down, for the man said to us, ‘You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.’”\n     [6] Israel said, “Why did you treat me so badly, telling the man that you had another brother?”\n     [7] They said, “The man asked directly concerning ourselves, and concerning our relatives, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?’ We just answered his questions. Is there any way we could know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down?’”\n     [8] Judah said to Israel, his father, “Send the boy with me, and we’ll get up and go, so that we may live, and not die, both we, and you, and also our little ones.  [9] I’ll be collateral for him. From my hand will you require him. If I don’t bring him to you, and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever;  [10] for if we hadn’t delayed, surely we would have returned a second time by now.”\n     [11] Their father, Israel, said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: Take from the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry down a present for the man, a little balm, a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts, and almonds;  [12] and take double money in your hand, and take back the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it was an oversight.  [13] Take your brother also, get up, and return to the man.  [14] May God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that He may release to you your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.”\n     [15] The men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and got up, went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.  [16] When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, “Bring the men into the house, and butcher an animal, and prepare; for the men will dine with me at noon.”\n     [17] The man did as Joseph commanded, and the man brought the men to Joseph’s house.  [18] The men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph’s house; and they said, “Because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time, we’re brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, attack us, and seize us as slaves, along with our donkeys.”  [19] They came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they spoke to him at the door of the house,  [20] and said, “Oh, my lord, we indeed came down the first time to buy food.  [21] When we came to the lodging place, we opened our sacks, and behold, each man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. We have brought it back in our hand.  [22] We have brought down other money in our hand to buy food. We don’t know who put our money in our sacks.”\n     [23] He said, “Peace be to you. Don’t be afraid. Your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks. I received your money.” He brought Simeon out to them.  [24] The man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet. He gave their donkeys fodder.  [25] They prepared the present for Joseph’s coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.\n     [26] When Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves down to the earth before him.  [27] He asked them of their welfare, and said, “Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he yet alive?”\n     [28] They said, “Your servant, our father, is well. He is still alive.” They bowed down humbly.  [29] He lifted up His eyes, and saw Benjamin, His brother, His mother’s son, and said, “Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?” He said, “God be gracious to you, my son.”  [30] Joseph hurried, for his heart yearned over his brother; and he sought a place to weep. He entered into his room, and wept there.  [31] He washed his face, and came out. He controlled himself, and said, “Serve the meal.”\n     [32] They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians don’t eat with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.  [33] They sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth, and the men marveled with one another.  [34] He sent portions to them from before him, but Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as any of theirs. They drank, and were merry with him.\n"

[2] Put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, with his grain money.” He did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.  [3] As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys.  [4] When they had gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, “Up, follow after the men. When you overtake them, ask them, ‘Why have you rewarded evil for good?  [5] Isn’t this that from which my lord drinks, and by which he indeed divines? You have done evil in so doing.’”  [6] He overtook them, and he spoke these words to them.\n     [7] They said to him, “Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing!  [8] Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan. How then should we steal silver or gold out of your lord’s house?  [9] With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die, and we also will be my lord’s slaves.”\n     [10] He said, “Now also let it be according to your words.

[12] He searched, beginning with the oldest, and ending at the youngest. The cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.  [13] Then they tore their clothes, and each man loaded his donkey, and returned to the city.\n     [14] Judah and his brothers came to Joseph’s house, and he was still there. They fell on the ground before him.  [15] Joseph said to them, “What deed is this that you have done? Don’t you know that such a man as I can indeed do divination?”\n     [16] Judah said, “What will we tell my lord? What will we speak? How will we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants. Behold, we are my lord’s slaves, both we and He also in whose hand the cup is found.”\n     [17] He said, “Far be it from me that I should do so. The man in whose hand the cup is found, he will be my slave; but as for you, go up in peace to your father.”\n     [18] Then Judah came near to him, and said, “Oh, my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord’s ears, and don’t let your anger burn against your servant; for you are even as Pharaoh.  [19] My lord asked his servants, saying, ‘Have you a father, or a brother?’  [20] We said to my lord, ‘We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loves him.’  [21] You said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.’  [22] We said to my lord, ‘The boy can’t leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.’  [23] You said to your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will see my face no more.’  [24] When we came up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.  [25] Our father said, ‘Go again and buy us a little food.’  [26] We said, ‘We can’t go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down: for we may not see the man’s face, unless our youngest brother is with us.’  [27] Your servant, my father, said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons.  [28] One went out from me, and I said, “Surely he is torn in pieces;” and I haven’t seen him since.  [29] If you take this one also from me, and harm happens to him, you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.’  [30] Now therefore when I come to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us; since his life is bound up in the boy’s life;  [31] it will happen, when he sees that the boy is no more, that he will die. Your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant, our father, with sorrow to Sheol.  [32] For your servant became collateral for the boy to my father, saying, ‘If I don’t bring him to you, then I will bear the blame to my father forever.’  [33] Now therefore, please let your servant stay instead of the boy, my lord’s slave; and let the boy go up with his brothers.

Does my father still live?”\n    His brothers couldn’t answer him; for they were terrified at his presence.  [4] Joseph said to his brothers, “Come near to me, please.”\n    They came near. He said, “I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt.  [5] Now don’t be grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life.  [6] For these two years the famine has been in the land, and there are yet five years, in which there will be no plowing and no harvest.  [7] God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance.  [8] So now it wasn’t you who sent me here, but God, and He has made me a father to Pharaoh, lord of all His house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.  [9] Hurry, and go up to my father, and tell Him, ‘This is what your son Joseph says, “God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me. Don’t wait.  [10] You shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you will be near to me, you, your children, your children’s children, your flocks, your herds, and all that you have.

[13] You shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that you have seen. You shall hurry and bring my father down here.”  [14] He fell on his brother Benjamin’s neck and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck.  [15] He kissed all his brothers, and wept on them. After that his brothers talked with him.\n     [16] The report of it was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, “Joseph’s brothers have come.” It pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.  [17] Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Tell your brothers, ‘Do this: Load your animals, and go, travel to the land of Canaan.  [18] Take your father and your households, and come to me, and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and you will eat the fat of the land.’  [19] Now you are commanded to do this: Take wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.  [20] Also, don’t concern yourselves about your belongings, for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.”\n     [21] The sons of Israel did so. Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.  [22] He gave each one of them changes of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing.  [23] He sent the following to his father: ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way.  [24] So he sent his brothers away, and they departed. He said to them, “See that you don’t quarrel on the way.”\n     [25] They went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father.  [26] They told him, saying, “Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt.” His heart fainted, for he didn’t believe them.  [27] They told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them. When he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob, their father, revived.

All the souls of the house of Jacob, who came into Egypt, were seventy.\n     [28] Jacob sent Judah before him to Joseph, to show the way before him to Goshen, and they came into the land of Goshen.  [29] Joseph prepared his chariot, and went up to meet Israel, his father, in Goshen. He presented himself to him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.  [30] Israel said to Joseph, “Now let me die, since I have seen your face, that you are still alive.”\n     [31] Joseph said to his brothers, and to his father’s house, “I will go up, and speak with Pharaoh, and will tell him, ‘My brothers, and my father’s house, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me.  [32] These men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock, and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.’  [33] It will happen, when Pharaoh summons you, and will say, ‘What is your occupation?’  [34] that you shall say, ‘Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers:’ that you may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.”\n"

[3] Pharaoh said to his brothers, “What is your occupation?”\n    They said to Pharaoh, “Your servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers.”  [4] They also said to Pharaoh, “We have come to live as foreigners in the land, for there is no pasture for your servants’ flocks. For the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.”\n     [5] Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, “Your father and your brothers have come to you.  [6] The land of Egypt is before you. Make your father and your brothers dwell in the best of the land. Let them dwell in the land of Goshen. If you know any able men among them, then put them in charge of my livestock.”\n     [7] Joseph brought in Jacob, his father, and set him before Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.  [8] Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How old are you?”\n     [9] Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The years of my pilgrimage are one hundred thirty years. The days of the years of my life have been few and evil. They have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.”  [10] Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.\n     [11] Joseph placed his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.  [12] Joseph provided his father, his brothers, and all of his father’s household with bread, according to the sizes of their families.\n     [13] There was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.  [14] Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house.  [15] When the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, “Give us bread, for why should we die in your presence? For our money fails.”\n     [16] Joseph said, “Give me your livestock; and I will give you food for your livestock, if your money is gone.”\n     [17] They brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the donkeys: and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their livestock for that year.  [18] When that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, “We will not hide from my lord how our money is all spent, and the herds of livestock are my lord’s. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands.  [19] Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. Give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land won’t be desolate.”\n     [20] So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for every man of the Egyptians sold his field, because the famine was severe on them, and the land became Pharaoh’s.  [21] As for the people, he moved them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end of it.  [22] Only he didn’t buy the land of the priests, for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them. That is why they didn’t sell their land.  [23] Then Joseph said to the people, “Behold, I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh. Behold, here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land.  [24] It will happen at the harvests, that you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts will be your own, for seed of the field, for your food, for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.”\n     [25] They said, “You have saved our lives! Let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.”\n     [26] Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth. Only the land of the priests alone didn’t become Pharaoh’s.\n     [27] Israel lived in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they got themselves possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.  [28] Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one hundred forty-seven years.  [29] The time came near that Israel must die, and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, “If now I have found favor in your sight, please put your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me. Please don’t bury me in Egypt,  [30] but when I sleep with my fathers, you shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying place.”\n    Joseph said, “I will do as you have said.”\n     [31] Israel said, “Swear to me,” and he swore to him. Then Israel bowed himself on the bed’s head.\n"

[2] Someone told Jacob, and said, “Behold, your son Joseph comes to you,” and Israel strengthened himself, and sat on the bed.  [3] Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,  [4] and said to me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your offspring after you for an everlasting possession.’  [5] Now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, will be mine.  [6] Your offspring, whom you become the father of after them, will be yours. They will be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance.  [7] As for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (also called Bethlehem).”\n     [8] Israel saw Joseph’s sons, and said, “Who are these?”\n     [9] Joseph said to His father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me here.”\n    He said, “Please bring them to me, and I will bless them.”  [10] Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he couldn’t see well. Joseph brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.  [11] Israel said to Joseph, “I didn’t think I would see your face, and behold, God has let me see your offspring also.”  [12] Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.  [13] Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them near to him.  [14] Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it on Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands knowingly, for Manasseh was the firstborn.  [15] He blessed Joseph, and said,\n  “The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked,\n  the God who has fed me all my life long to this day,\n   [16] the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads,\n  and let my name be named on them,\n  and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac.\n  Let them grow into a multitude upon the earth.”\n     [17] When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him. He held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head.  [18] Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn. Put your right hand on his head.”\n     [19] His father refused, and said, “I know, my son, I know. He also will become a people, and he also will be great. However, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his offspring will become a multitude of nations.”  [20] He blessed them that day, saying, “Israel will bless in you, saying, ‘God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh’” He set Ephraim before Manasseh.  [21] Israel said to Joseph, “Behold, I am dying, but God will be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers.  [22] Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.”\n"

[20] As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to save many people alive, as is happening today.  [21] Now therefore don’t be afraid. I will provide for you and your little ones.” He comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.\n     [22] Joseph lived in Egypt, he, and his father’s house. Joseph lived one hundred ten years.

[10] Come, let’s deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it happen that when any war breaks out, they also join themselves to our enemies and fight against us, and escape out of the land.”  [11] Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. They built storage cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Raamses.  [12] But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out. They started to dread the children of Israel.

[18] The king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, “Why have you done this thing and saved the boys alive?”\n     [19] The midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women aren’t like the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife comes to them.”\n     [20] God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied, and grew very mighty.

[16] Go and gather the elders of Israel together, and tell them, ‘Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, “I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt.  [17] I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey.”’  [18] They will listen to your voice. You shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you shall tell Him, ‘Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Now please let us go three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to Yahweh, our God.’  [19] I know that the king of Egypt won’t give you permission to go, no, not by a mighty hand.  [20] I will reach out my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do among them, and after that he will let you go.  [21] I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, and it will happen that when you go, you shall not go empty-handed.  [22] But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her who visits her house, jewels of silver, jewels of gold, and clothing. You shall put them on your sons, and on your daughters. You shall plunder the Egyptians.”\n"

Or who makes one mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Isn’t it I, Yahweh?  [12] Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth, and teach you what you shall speak.”\n     [13] Moses said, “Oh, Lord, please send someone else.”\n     [14] Yahweh’s anger burned against Moses, and He said, “What about Aaron, your brother, the Levite?

Behold, I will kill your firstborn son.’”\n     [24] On the way at a lodging place, Yahweh met Moses and wanted to kill Him.  [25] Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet; and she said, “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me.”\n     [26] So he let him alone. Then she said, “You are a bridegroom of blood,” because of the circumcision.\n     [27] Yahweh said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.”\n    He went, and met Him on God’s mountain, and kissed Him.

There will be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.’”\n     [20] Moses and Aaron did so, as Yahweh commanded; and He lifted up the rod, and struck the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of His servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.

The hail will come down on every man and animal that is found in the field, and isn’t brought home, and they will die.”’”\n     [20] Those who feared Yahweh’s word among the servants of Pharaoh made their servants and their livestock flee into the houses.

Yahweh rained hail on the land of Egypt.  [24] So there was very severe hail, and lightning mixed with the hail, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.  [25] The hail struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and animal; and the hail struck every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field.

Yahweh is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.  [28] Pray to Yahweh; for there has been enough of mighty thunderings and hail. I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer.”\n     [29] Moses said to Him, “As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands to Yahweh. The thunders shall cease, and there will not be any more hail; that you may know that the earth is Yahweh’s.  [30] But as for you and your servants, I know that you don’t yet fear Yahweh God.”\n     [31] The flax and the barley were struck, for the barley had ripened and the flax was blooming.  [32] But the wheat and the spelt were not struck, for they had not grown up.

Let my people go, that they may serve me.  [4] Or else, if you refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country,  [5] and they shall cover the surface of the earth, so that one won’t be able to see the earth. They shall eat the residue of that which has escaped, which remains to you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which grows for you out of the field.  [6] Your houses shall be filled, and the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians, as neither your fathers nor your fathers’ fathers have seen, since the day that they were on the earth to this day.’” He turned, and went out from Pharaoh.\n     [7] Pharaoh’s servants said to Him, “How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve Yahweh, their God. Don’t you yet know that Egypt is destroyed?”\n     [8] Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh, and He said to them, “Go, serve Yahweh your God; but who are those who will go?”\n     [9] Moses said, “We will go with our young and with our old. We will go with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds; for we must hold a feast to Yahweh.”\n     [10] He said to them, “Yahweh be with you if I let you go with your little ones! See, evil is clearly before your faces.  [11] Not so! Go now you who are men, and serve Yahweh; for that is what you desire!” Then they were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence.\n     [12] Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up on the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail has left.”  [13] Moses stretched out His rod over the land of Egypt, and Yahweh brought an east wind on the land all that day, and all night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.  [14] The locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt. They were very grievous. Before them there were no such locusts as they, nor will there ever be again.  [15] For they covered the surface of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened, and they ate every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left. There remained nothing green, either tree or herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt.  [16] Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste, and He said, “I have sinned against Yahweh your God, and against you.  [17] Now therefore please forgive my sin again, and pray to Yahweh your God, that He may also take away from me this death.”\n     [18] Moses went out from Pharaoh, and prayed to Yahweh.  [19] Yahweh sent an exceedingly strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea. There remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt.  [20] But Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and He didn’t let the children of Israel go.\n     [21] Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.”  [22] Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days.  [23] They didn’t see one another, and nobody rose from his place for three days; but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.\n     [24] Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, “Go, serve Yahweh. Only let your flocks and your herds stay behind. Let your little ones also go with you.”\n     [25] Moses said, “You must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to Yahweh our God.  [26] Our livestock also shall go with us. Not a hoof shall be left behind, for of it we must take to serve Yahweh our God; and we don’t know with what we must serve Yahweh, until we come there.”\n     [27] But Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and He wouldn’t let them go.  [28] Pharaoh said to him, “Get away from me! Be careful to see my face no more; for in the day you see my face you shall die!”\n     [29] Moses said, “You have spoken well. I will see your face again no more.”\n"

[3] Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying, ‘On the tenth day of this month, they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers’ houses, a lamb for a household;  [4] and if the household is too little for a lamb, then he and his neighbor next to his house shall take one according to the number of the souls. You shall make your count for the lamb according to what everyone can eat.  [5] Your lamb shall be without defect, a male a year old. You shall take it from the sheep or from the goats.  [6] You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month; and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at evening.  [7] They shall take some of the blood, and put it on the two door posts and on the lintel, on the houses in which they shall eat it.  [8] They shall eat the meat in that night, roasted with fire, with unleavened bread. They shall eat it with bitter herbs.  [9] Don’t eat it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted with fire; with its head, its legs and its inner parts.  [10] You shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; but that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn with fire.  [11] This is how you shall eat it: with your belt on your waist, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste: it is Yahweh’s Passover.  [12] For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and animal. I will execute judgments against all the gods of Egypt. I am Yahweh.  [13] The blood shall be to you for a token on the houses where you are. When I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague will be on you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.  [14] This day shall be a memorial for you. You shall keep it as a feast to Yahweh. You shall keep it as a feast throughout your generations by an ordinance forever.\n     [15] “‘Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread; even the first day you shall put away yeast out of your houses, for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.  [16] In the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no kind of work shall be done in them, except that which every man must eat, only that may be done by you.  [17] You shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this same day I have brought your armies out of the land of Egypt. Therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance forever.  [18] In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty first day of the month at evening.  [19] There shall be no yeast found in your houses for seven days, for whoever eats that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he is a foreigner, or one who is born in the land.  [20] You shall eat nothing leavened. In all your habitations you shall eat unleavened bread.’”\n     [21] Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, “Draw out, and take lambs according to your families, and kill the Passover.  [22] You shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two door posts with the blood that is in the basin. None of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning.  [23] For Yahweh will pass through to strike the Egyptians; and when He sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two door posts, Yahweh will pass over the door, and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to strike you.  [24] You shall observe this thing for an ordinance to you and to your sons forever.  [25] It shall happen when you have come to the land which Yahweh will give you, as He has promised, that you shall keep this service.  [26] It will happen, when your children ask you, ‘What do you mean by this service?’  [27] that you shall say, ‘It is the sacrifice of Yahweh’s Passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when He struck the Egyptians, and spared our houses.’”\n    The people bowed their heads and worshiped.  [28] The children of Israel went and did so; as Yahweh had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.\n     [29] At midnight, Yahweh struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on His throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of livestock.  [30] Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one dead.  [31] He called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, “Rise up, get out from among my people, both you and the children of Israel; and go, serve Yahweh, as you have said!  [32] Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone; and bless me also!”\n     [33] The Egyptians were urgent with the people, to send them out of the land in haste, for they said, “We are all dead men.”  [34] The people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes on their shoulders.  [35] The children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing.  [36] Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. They plundered the Egyptians.\n     [37] The children of Israel traveled from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot who were men, in addition to children.  [38] A mixed multitude went up also with them, with flocks, herds, and even very much livestock.  [39] They baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought out of Egypt; for it wasn’t leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and couldn’t wait, and they had not prepared any food for themselves.  [40] Now the time that the children of Israel lived in Egypt was four hundred thirty years.  [41] At the end of four hundred thirty years, to the day, all of Yahweh’s armies went out from the land of Egypt.  [42] It is a night to be much observed to Yahweh for bringing them out from the land of Egypt. This is that night of Yahweh, to be much observed by all the children of Israel throughout their generations.\n     [43] Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, “This is the ordinance of the Passover. No foreigner shall eat of it,  [44] but every man’s servant who is bought for money, when you have circumcised him, then shall he eat of it.  [45] A foreigner and a hired servant shall not eat of it.  [46] It must be eaten in one house. You shall not carry any of the meat outside of the house. Do not break any of its bones.  [47] All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.  [48] When a stranger lives as a foreigner with you, and would like to keep the Passover to Yahweh, let all His males be circumcised, and then let Him come near and keep it. He shall be as one who is born in the land; but no uncircumcised person shall eat of it.  [49] One law shall be to him who is born at home, and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner among you.”  [50] All the children of Israel did so. As Yahweh commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.  [51] That same day, Yahweh brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.\n"

The males shall be Yahweh’s.

Therefore I sacrifice to Yahweh all that opens the womb, being males; but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.’  [16] It shall be for a sign on your hand, and for symbols between your eyes; for by strength of hand Yahweh brought us out of Egypt.”\n     [17] When Pharaoh had let the people go, God didn’t lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, “Lest perhaps the people change their minds when they see war, and they return to Egypt”;  [18] but God led the people around by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea; and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt.  [19] Moses took the bones of Joseph with Him, for He had made the children of Israel swear, saying, “God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones away from here with you.”  [20] They took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.  [21] Yahweh went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them on their way, and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light, that they might go by day and by night:  [22] the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, didn’t depart from before the people.\n"

All the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen, and his army overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baal Zephon.\n     [10] When Pharaoh came near, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them; and they were very afraid. The children of Israel cried out to Yahweh.  [11] They said to Moses, “Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you treated us this way, to bring us out of Egypt?  [12] Isn’t this the word that we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, ‘Leave us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians?’ For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.”\n     [13] Moses said to the people, “Don’t be afraid. Stand still, and see the salvation of Yahweh, which He will work for you today; for you will never again see the Egyptians whom you have seen today.  [14] Yahweh will fight for you, and you shall be still.”\n     [15] Yahweh said to Moses, “Why do you cry to me? Speak to the children of Israel, that they go forward.  [16] Lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it. Then the children of Israel shall go into the middle of the sea on dry ground.

I will get myself honor over Pharaoh, and over all his armies, over his chariots, and over his horsemen.  [18] The Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh when I have gotten myself honor over Pharaoh, over His chariots, and over His horsemen.”  [19] The angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them, and stood behind them.  [20] It came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel. There was the cloud and the darkness, yet it gave light by night. One didn’t come near the other all night.\n     [21] Moses stretched out His hand over the sea, and Yahweh caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.  [22] The children of Israel went into the middle of the sea on the dry ground; and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.  [23] The Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the middle of the sea: all of Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.  [24] In the morning watch, Yahweh looked out on the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and confused the Egyptian army.  [25] He took off their chariot wheels, and they drove them heavily; so that the Egyptians said, “Let’s flee from the face of Israel, for Yahweh fights for them against the Egyptians!”\n     [26] Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come again on the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen.”  [27] Moses stretched out His hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it. Yahweh overthrew the Egyptians in the middle of the sea.  [28] The waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen, even all Pharaoh’s army that went in after them into the sea. There remained not so much as one of them.  [29] But the children of Israel walked on dry land in the middle of the sea, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.  [30] Thus Yahweh saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.

[11] Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  [12] “I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel. Speak to them, saying, ‘At evening you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am Yahweh your God.’”\n     [13] In the evening, quail came up and covered the camp; and in the morning the dew lay around the camp.  [14] When the dew that lay had gone, behold, on the surface of the wilderness was a small round thing, small as the frost on the ground.  [15] When the children of Israel saw it, they said to one another, “What is it?” For they didn’t know what it was. Moses said to them, “It is the bread which Yahweh has given you to eat.  [16] This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded: ‘Gather of it everyone according to His eating; an omer a head, according to the number of your persons, you shall take it, every man for those who are in His tent.’”  [17] The children of Israel did so, and some gathered more, some less.  [18] When they measured it with an omer, he who gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little had no lack. They each gathered according to his eating.  [19] Moses said to them, “Let no one leave of it until the morning.”  [20] Notwithstanding they didn’t listen to Moses, but some of them left of it until the morning, so it bred worms and became foul; and Moses was angry with them.  [21] They gathered it morning by morning, everyone according to his eating. When the sun grew hot, it melted.  [22] On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one; and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.  [23] He said to them, “This is that which Yahweh has spoken, ‘Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to Yahweh. Bake that which you want to bake, and boil that which you want to boil; and all that remains over lay up for yourselves to be kept until the morning.’”  [24] They laid it up until the morning, as Moses ordered, and it didn’t become foul, and there were no worms in it.  [25] Moses said, “Eat that today, for today is a Sabbath to Yahweh. Today you shall not find it in the field.  [26] Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day is the Sabbath. In it there shall be none.”  [27] On the seventh day, some of the people went out to gather, and they found none.  [28] Yahweh said to Moses, “How long do you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?  [29] Behold, because Yahweh has given you the Sabbath, therefore He gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days. Everyone stay in His place. Let no one go out of His place on the seventh day.”  [30] So the people rested on the seventh day.\n     [31] The house of Israel called its name “Manna”, and it was like coriander seed, white; and its taste was like wafers with honey.  [32] Moses said, “This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded, ‘Let an omer-full of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.’”  [33] Moses said to Aaron, “Take a pot, and put an omer-full of manna in it, and lay it up before Yahweh, to be kept throughout your generations.”  [34] As Yahweh commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.  [35] The children of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land. They ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.  [36] Now an omer is one tenth of an ephah.\n"

[2] Therefore the people quarreled with Moses, and said, “Give us water to drink.”\n    Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test Yahweh?”\n     [3] The people were thirsty for water there; so the people murmured against Moses, and said, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us, our children, and our livestock with thirst?”\n     [4] Moses cried to Yahweh, saying, “What shall I do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me.”\n     [5] Yahweh said to Moses, “Walk on before the people, and take the elders of Israel with you, and take the rod in your hand with which you struck the Nile, and go.  [6] Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb. You shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink.” Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.  [7] He called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because the children of Israel quarreled, and because they tested Yahweh, saying, “Is Yahweh among us, or not?”\n     [8] Then Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim.  [9] Moses said to Joshua, “Choose men for us, and go out to fight with Amalek.

[11] When Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed. When he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.  [12] But Moses’ hands were heavy; so they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side. His hands were steady until sunset.  [13] Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.  [14] Yahweh said to Moses, “Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky.”  [15] Moses built an altar, and called its name “Yahweh our Banner”.

[2] Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, received Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he had sent her away,  [3] and her two sons. The name of one son was Gershom, for Moses said, “I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land”.  [4] The name of the other was Eliezer, for He said, “My father’s God was my help and delivered me from Pharaoh’s sword.”  [5] Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came with Moses’ sons and His wife to Moses into the wilderness where He was encamped, at the Mountain of God.  [6] He said to Moses, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, have come to you with your wife, and her two sons with her.”\n     [7] Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and bowed and kissed him. They asked each other of their welfare, and they came into the tent.  [8] Moses told His father-in-law all that Yahweh had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the hardships that had come on them on the way, and how Yahweh delivered them.  [9] Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which Yahweh had done to Israel, in that He had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.  [10] Jethro said, “Blessed be Yahweh, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh; who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.  [11] Now I know that Yahweh is greater than all gods because of the way that they treated people arrogantly.”  [12] Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God. Aaron came with all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law before God.\n     [13] On the next day, Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood around Moses from the morning to the evening.  [14] When Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, “What is this thing that you do for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you from morning to evening?”\n     [15] Moses said to His father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to inquire of God.  [16] When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between a man and His neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of God, and His laws.”  [17] Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “The thing that you do is not good.  [18] You will surely wear away, both you, and this people that is with you; for the thing is too heavy for you. You are not able to perform it yourself alone.  [19] Listen now to my voice. I will give you counsel, and God be with you. You represent the people before God, and bring the causes to God.  [20] You shall teach them the statutes and the laws, and shall show them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do.  [21] Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men which fear God: men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.  [22] Let them judge the people at all times. It shall be that every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they shall judge themselves. So shall it be easier for you, and they shall share the load with you.  [23] If you will do this thing, and God commands you so, then you will be able to endure, and all these people also will go to their place in peace.”\n     [24] So Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.  [25] Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.  [26] They judged the people at all times. They brought the hard cases to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.  [27] Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went his way into his own land.\n"

[2] When they had departed from Rephidim, and had come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mountain.  [3] Moses went up to God, and Yahweh called to Him out of the mountain, saying, “This is what you shall tell the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel:  [4] ‘You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles’ wings, and brought you to myself.  [5] Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, then you shall be my own possession from among all peoples; for all the earth is mine;  [6] and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.”\n     [7] Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which Yahweh commanded Him.  [8] All the people answered together, and said, “All that Yahweh has spoken we will do.”\n    Moses reported the words of the people to Yahweh.  [9] Yahweh said to Moses, “Behold, I come to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever.” Moses told the words of the people to Yahweh.  [10] Yahweh said to Moses, “Go to the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments,  [11] and be ready for the third day; for on the third day Yahweh will come down in the sight of all the people on Mount Sinai.  [12] You shall set bounds to the people all around, saying, ‘Be careful that you don’t go up onto the mountain, or touch its border. Whoever touches the mountain shall be surely put to death.  [13] No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether it is animal or man, he shall not live.’ When the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mountain.”\n     [14] Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.  [15] He said to the people, “Be ready by the third day. Don’t have sexual relations with a woman.”\n     [16] On the third day, when it was morning, there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the mountain, and the sound of an exceedingly loud trumpet; and all the people who were in the camp trembled.  [17] Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the lower part of the mountain.  [18] All of Mount Sinai smoked, because Yahweh descended on it in fire; and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked greatly.  [19] When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered Him by a voice.  [20] Yahweh came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. Yahweh called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.\n     [21] Yahweh said to Moses, “Go down, warn the people, lest they break through to Yahweh to gaze, and many of them perish.  [22] Let the priests also, who come near to Yahweh, sanctify themselves, lest Yahweh break out on them.”\n     [23] Moses said to Yahweh, “The people can’t come up to Mount Sinai, for you warned us, saying, ‘Set bounds around the mountain, and sanctify it.’”\n     [24] Yahweh said to Him, “Go down! You shall bring Aaron up with you, but don’t let the priests and the people break through to come up to Yahweh, lest He break out against them.”\n     [25] So Moses went down to the people, and told them.\n"

[6] Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.

[21] You shall take of the blood that is on the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron, and on his garments, and on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be made holy, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons’ garments with him.  [22] Also you shall take some of the ram’s fat, the fat tail, the fat that covers the innards, the cover of the liver, the two kidneys, the fat that is on them, and the right thigh (for it is a ram of consecration),  [23] and one loaf of bread, one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of unleavened bread that is before Yahweh.  [24] You shall put all of this in Aaron’s hands, and in His sons’ hands, and shall wave them for a wave offering before Yahweh.  [25] You shall take them from their hands, and burn them on the altar on the burnt offering, for a pleasant aroma before Yahweh: it is an offering made by fire to Yahweh.\n     [26] “You shall take the breast of Aaron’s ram of consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before Yahweh. It shall be your portion.  [27] You shall sanctify the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the wave offering, which is waved, and which is raised up, of the ram of consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons.  [28] It shall be for Aaron and His sons as their portion forever from the children of Israel; for it is a wave offering. It shall be a wave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifices of their peace offerings, even their wave offering to Yahweh.\n     [29] “The holy garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him, to be anointed in them, and to be consecrated in them.  [30] Seven days shall the son who is priest in his place put them on, when he comes into the Tent of Meeting to minister in the holy place.\n     [31] “You shall take the ram of consecration and boil its meat in a holy place.  [32] Aaron and his sons shall eat the meat of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, at the door of the Tent of Meeting.  [33] They shall eat those things with which atonement was made, to consecrate and sanctify them; but a stranger shall not eat of it, because they are holy.  [34] If anything of the meat of the consecration, or of the bread, remains to the morning, then you shall burn the remainder with fire. It shall not be eaten, because it is holy.\n     [35] “You shall do so to Aaron and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded you. You shall consecrate them seven days.  [36] Every day you shall offer the bull of sin offering for atonement. You shall cleanse the altar when you make atonement for it. You shall anoint it, to sanctify it.  [37] Seven days you shall make atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and the altar shall be most holy. Whatever touches the altar shall be holy.\n     [38] “Now this is that which you shall offer on the altar: two lambs a year old day by day continually.  [39] The one lamb you shall offer in the morning; and the other lamb you shall offer at evening;  [40] and with the one lamb a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mixed with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil, and the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink offering.  [41] The other lamb you shall offer at evening, and shall do to it according to the meal offering of the morning and according to its drink offering, for a pleasant aroma, an offering made by fire to Yahweh.  [42] It shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the Tent of Meeting before Yahweh, where I will meet with you, to speak there to you.  [43] There I will meet with the children of Israel; and the place shall be sanctified by my glory.  [44] I will sanctify the Tent of Meeting and the altar. I will also sanctify Aaron and his sons to minister to me in the priest’s office.  [45] I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.  [46] They shall know that I am Yahweh their God, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, that I might dwell among them: I am Yahweh their God.\n"

[4] He received what they handed him, fashioned it with an engraving tool, and made it a molded calf. Then they said, “These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.”\n     [5] When Aaron saw this, He built an altar before it; and Aaron made a proclamation, and said, “Tomorrow shall be a feast to Yahweh.”\n     [6] They rose up early on the next day, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.\n     [7] Yahweh spoke to Moses, “Go, get down; for your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves!  [8] They have turned away quickly out of the way which I commanded them. They have made themselves a molded calf, and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, ‘These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.’”\n     [9] Yahweh said to Moses, “I have seen these people, and behold, they are a stiff-necked people.  [10] Now therefore leave me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them, and that I may consume them; and I will make of you a great nation.”\n     [11] Moses begged Yahweh His God, and said, “Yahweh, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, that you have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?  [12] Why should the Egyptians talk, saying, ‘He brought them out for evil, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the surface of the earth?’ Turn from your fierce wrath, and turn away from this evil against your people.  [13] Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, ‘I will multiply your offspring as the stars of the sky, and all this land that I have spoken of I will give to your offspring, and they shall inherit it forever.’”\n     [14] So Yahweh turned away from the evil which He said He would do to His people.\n     [15] Moses turned, and went down from the mountain, with the two tablets of the covenant in his hand; tablets that were written on both their sides. They were written on one side and on the other.  [16] The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.\n     [17] When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, “There is the noise of war in the camp.”\n     [18] He said, “It isn’t the voice of those who shout for victory. It is not the voice of those who cry for being overcome; but the noise of those who sing that I hear.”  [19] As soon as he came near to the camp, he saw the calf and the dancing. Then Moses’ anger grew hot, and he threw the tablets out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mountain.  [20] He took the calf which they had made, and burned it with fire, ground it to powder, and scattered it on the water, and made the children of Israel drink it.\n     [21] Moses said to Aaron, “What did these people do to you, that you have brought a great sin on them?”\n     [22] Aaron said, “Don’t let the anger of my lord grow hot. You know the people, that they are set on evil.  [23] For they said to me, ‘Make us gods, which shall go before us. As for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don’t know what has become of him.’  [24] I said to them, ‘Whoever has any gold, let them take it off.’ So they gave it to me; and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf.”\n     [25] When Moses saw that the people were out of control, (for Aaron had let them lose control, causing derision among their enemies),  [26] then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, “Whoever is on Yahweh’s side, come to me!”\n    All the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to Him.  [27] He said to them, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘Every man put His sword on His thigh, and go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and every man kill His brother, and every man His companion, and every man His neighbor.’”  [28] The sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses. About three thousand men fell of the people that day.  [29] Moses said, “Consecrate yourselves today to Yahweh, for every man was against His son and against His brother, that He may give you a blessing today.”\n     [30] On the next day, Moses said to the people, “You have sinned a great sin. Now I will go up to Yahweh. Perhaps I shall make atonement for your sin.”\n     [31] Moses returned to Yahweh, and said, “Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made themselves gods of gold.  [32] Yet now, if you will, forgive their sin—and if not, please blot me out of your book which you have written.”\n     [33] Yahweh said to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against me, I will blot Him out of my book.  [34] Now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you. Behold, my angel shall go before you. Nevertheless, in the day when I punish, I will punish them for their sin.”  [35] Yahweh struck the people, because of what they did with the calf, which Aaron made.\n"

Yet you have said, ‘I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.’  [13] Now therefore, if I have found favor in your sight, please show me your way, now, that I may know you, so that I may find favor in your sight; and consider that this nation is your people.”\n     [14] He said, “My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.”\n     [15] Moses said to him, “If your presence doesn’t go with me, don’t carry us up from here.  [16] For how would people know that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people? Isn’t it that you go with us, so that we are separated, I and your people, from all the people who are on the surface of the earth?”\n     [17] Yahweh said to Moses, “I will do this thing also that you have spoken; for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name.”\n     [18] Moses said, “Please show me your glory.”\n     [19] He said, “I will make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim Yahweh’s name before you. I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.”  [20] He said, “You cannot see my face, for man may not see me and live.”  [21] Yahweh also said, “Behold, there is a place by me, and you shall stand on the rock.  [22] It will happen, while my glory passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and will cover you with my hand until I have passed by;  [23] then I will take away my hand, and you will see my back; but my face shall not be seen.”\n"

Whoever is of a willing heart, let Him bring it as Yahweh’s offering: gold, silver, bronze,  [6] blue, purple, scarlet, fine linen, goats’ hair,  [7] rams’ skins dyed red, sea cow hides, acacia wood,  [8] oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for the sweet incense,  [9] onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplate.\n     [10] “‘Let every wise-hearted man among you come, and make all that Yahweh has commanded:  [11] the tabernacle, its outer covering, its roof, its clasps, its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets;  [12] the ark, and its poles, the mercy seat, the veil of the screen;  [13] the table with its poles and all its vessels, and the show bread;  [14] the lamp stand also for the light, with its vessels, its lamps, and the oil for the light;  [15] and the altar of incense with its poles, the anointing oil, the sweet incense, the screen for the door, at the door of the tabernacle;  [16] the altar of burnt offering, with its grating of bronze, its poles, and all its vessels, the basin and its base;  [17] the hangings of the court, its pillars, their sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court;  [18] the pins of the tabernacle, the pins of the court, and their cords;  [19] the finely worked garments for ministering in the holy place—the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons—to minister in the priest’s office.’”\n     [20] All the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.  [21] They came, everyone whose heart stirred Him up, and everyone whom His spirit made willing, and brought Yahweh’s offering for the work of the Tent of Meeting, and for all of its service, and for the holy garments.  [22] They came, both men and women, as many as were willing-hearted, and brought brooches, earrings, signet rings, and armlets, all jewels of gold; even every man who offered an offering of gold to Yahweh.  [23] Everyone with whom was found blue, purple, scarlet, fine linen, goats’ hair, rams’ skins dyed red, and sea cow hides, brought them.  [24] Everyone who offered an offering of silver and bronze brought Yahweh’s offering; and everyone with whom was found acacia wood for any work of the service, brought it.  [25] All the women who were wise-hearted spun with their hands, and brought that which they had spun: the blue, the purple, the scarlet, and the fine linen.  [26] All the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun the goats’ hair.  [27] The rulers brought the onyx stones and the stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplate;  [28] with the spice and the oil for the light, for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.  [29] The children of Israel brought a free will offering to Yahweh; every man and woman whose heart made them willing to bring for all the work, which Yahweh had commanded to be made by Moses.\n     [30] Moses said to the children of Israel, “Behold, Yahweh has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.  [31] He has filled Him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, in knowledge, and in all kinds of workmanship;  [32] and to make skillful works, to work in gold, in silver, in bronze,  [33] in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all kinds of skillful workmanship.  [34] He has put in his heart that he may teach, both he and Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.  [35] He has filled them with wisdom of heart to work all kinds of workmanship, of the engraver, of the skillful workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of those who do any workmanship, and of those who make skillful works.\n"

[3] They received from Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, with which to make it. They kept bringing free will offerings to him every morning.  [4] All the wise men, who performed all the work of the sanctuary, each came from his work which he did.  [5] They spoke to Moses, saying, “The people have brought much more than enough for the service of the work which Yahweh commanded to make.”\n     [6] Moses gave a commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, “Let neither man nor woman make anything else for the offering for the sanctuary.” So the people were restrained from bringing.  [7] For the stuff they had was sufficient to do all the work, and too much.\n     [8] All the wise-hearted men among those who did the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen, blue, purple, and scarlet. They made them with cherubim, the work of a skillful workman.  [9] The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits. All the curtains had one measure.

[29] They were double beneath, and in the same way they were all the way to its top to one ring. He did this to both of them in the two corners.  [30] There were eight boards and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets—under every board two sockets.\n     [31] He made bars of acacia wood: five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,  [32] and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the hinder part westward.  [33] He made the middle bar to pass through in the middle of the boards from the one end to the other.  [34] He overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold as places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.\n     [35] He made the veil of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cherubim.

[23] He killed it; and Moses took some of its blood, and put it on the tip of Aaron’s right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot.  [24] He brought Aaron’s sons; and Moses put some of the blood on the tip of their right ear, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the great toe of their right foot; and Moses sprinkled the blood around on the altar.  [25] He took the fat, the fat tail, all the fat that was on the innards, the cover of the liver, the two kidneys and their fat, and the right thigh;  [26] and out of the basket of unleavened bread that was before Yahweh, He took one unleavened cake, one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat and on the right thigh.  [27] He put all these in Aaron’s hands and in His sons’ hands, and waved them for a wave offering before Yahweh.  [28] Moses took them from their hands, and burned them on the altar on the burnt offering. They were a consecration offering for a pleasant aroma. It was an offering made by fire to Yahweh.  [29] Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before Yahweh. It was Moses’ portion of the ram of consecration, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  [30] Moses took some of the anointing oil, and some of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments, and on his sons, and on his sons’ garments with him, and sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and his sons’ garments with him.\n     [31] Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, “Boil the meat at the door of the Tent of Meeting, and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat it.’  [32] What remains of the meat and of the bread you shall burn with fire.  [33] You shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting for seven days, until the days of your consecration are fulfilled: for he shall consecrate you seven days.  [34] What has been done today, so Yahweh has commanded to do, to make atonement for you.  [35] You shall stay at the door of the Tent of Meeting day and night seven days, and keep Yahweh’s command, that you don’t die: for so I am commanded.”  [36] Aaron and His sons did all the things which Yahweh commanded by Moses.\n"

[3] You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old, without defect, for a burnt offering;  [4] and a bull and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before Yahweh; and a meal offering mixed with oil: for today Yahweh appears to you.’”\n     [5] They brought what Moses commanded before the Tent of Meeting. All the congregation came near and stood before Yahweh.  [6] Moses said, “This is the thing which Yahweh commanded that you should do; and Yahweh’s glory shall appear to you.”  [7] Moses said to Aaron, “Draw near to the altar, and offer your sin offering, and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself, and for the people; and offer the offering of the people, and make atonement for them, as Yahweh commanded.”\n     [8] So Aaron came near to the altar, and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.  [9] The sons of Aaron presented the blood to him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar;  [10] but the fat, and the kidneys, and the cover from the liver of the sin offering, He burned upon the altar, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  [11] The meat and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp.  [12] He killed the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons delivered the blood to him, and he sprinkled it around on the altar.  [13] They delivered the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head. He burned them upon the altar.  [14] He washed the innards and the legs, and burned them on the burnt offering on the altar.  [15] He presented the people’s offering, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people, and killed it, and offered it for sin, like the first.  [16] He presented the burnt offering, and offered it according to the ordinance.  [17] He presented the meal offering, and filled his hand from there, and burned it upon the altar, in addition to the burnt offering of the morning.  [18] He also killed the bull and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people. Aaron’s sons delivered to him the blood, which he sprinkled around on the altar;  [19] and the fat of the bull and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covers the innards, and the kidneys, and the cover of the liver;  [20] and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burned the fat on the altar.  [21] Aaron waved the breasts and the right thigh for a wave offering before Yahweh, as Moses commanded.  [22] Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings.\n     [23] Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting, and came out, and blessed the people; and Yahweh’s glory appeared to all the people.  [24] Fire came out from before Yahweh, and consumed the burnt offering and the fat upon the altar. When all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces.\n"

[2] Fire came out from before Yahweh, and devoured them, and they died before Yahweh.\n     [3] Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what Yahweh spoke of, saying,\n  ‘I will show myself holy to those who come near me,\n    and before all the people I will be glorified.’”\n    Aaron held His peace.  [4] Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, “Draw near, carry your brothers from before the sanctuary out of the camp.”  [5] So they came near, and carried them in their tunics out of the camp, as Moses had said.\n     [6] Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, His sons, “Don’t let the hair of your heads go loose, and don’t tear your clothes, so that you don’t die, and so that He will not be angry with all the congregation; but let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which Yahweh has kindled.  [7] You shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting, lest you die; for the anointing oil of Yahweh is on you.” They did according to the word of Moses.

This shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.  [10] You are to make a distinction between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean.  [11] You are to teach the children of Israel all the statutes which Yahweh has spoken to them by Moses.”\n     [12] Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, His sons who were left, “Take the meal offering that remains of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire, and eat it without yeast beside the altar; for it is most holy;  [13] and you shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your portion, and your sons’ portion, of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire; for so I am commanded.  [14] The waved breast and the heaved thigh you shall eat in a clean place, you, and your sons, and your daughters with you: for they are given as your portion, and your sons’ portion, out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the children of Israel.  [15] They shall bring the heaved thigh and the waved breast with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before Yahweh. It shall be yours, and your sons’ with you, as a portion forever, as Yahweh has commanded.”\n     [16] Moses diligently inquired about the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burned. He was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were left, saying,  [17] “Why haven’t you eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary, since it is most holy, and He has given it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before Yahweh?  [18] Behold, its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary. You certainly should have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.”\n     [19] Aaron spoke to Moses, “Behold, today they have offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before Yahweh; and such things as these have happened to me. If I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been pleasing in Yahweh’s sight?”\n     [20] When Moses heard that, it was pleasing in his sight.\n"

It is a mildewed spot, whether the bareness is inside or outside.

[39] The priest shall come again on the seventh day, and look. If the plague has spread in the walls of the house,  [40] then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which is the plague, and cast them into an unclean place outside of the city.  [41] He shall cause the inside of the house to be scraped all over. They shall pour out the mortar that they scraped off outside of the city into an unclean place.  [42] They shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house.\n     [43] “If the plague comes again, and breaks out in the house after he has taken out the stones, and after he has scraped the house, and after it was plastered,  [44] then the priest shall come in and look; and behold, if the plague has spread in the house, it is a destructive mildew in the house. It is unclean.  [45] He shall break down the house, its stones, and its timber, and all the house’s mortar. He shall carry them out of the city into an unclean place.\n     [46] “Moreover he who goes into the house while it is shut up shall be unclean until the evening.  [47] He who lies down in the house shall wash his clothes; and he who eats in the house shall wash his clothes.\n     [48] “If the priest shall come in, and examine it, and behold, the plague hasn’t spread in the house, after the house was plastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.  [49] To cleanse the house he shall take two birds, cedar wood, scarlet, and hyssop.  [50] He shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water.  [51] He shall take the cedar wood, the hyssop, the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times.  [52] He shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, with the living bird, with the cedar wood, with the hyssop, and with the scarlet;  [53] but he shall let the living bird go out of the city into the open field. So shall he make atonement for the house; and it shall be clean.”\n     [54] This is the law for any plague of leprosy, and for an itch,  [55] and for the destructive mildew of a garment, and for a house,  [56] and for a swelling, and for a scab, and for a bright spot;  [57] to teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean.\n    This is the law of leprosy.\n"

[46] You may make them an inheritance for your children after you, to hold for a possession. Of them you may take your slaves forever, but over your brothers the children of Israel you shall not rule, one over another, with harshness.\n     [47] “‘If an alien or temporary resident with you becomes rich, and your brother beside him has grown poor, and sells himself to the stranger or foreigner living among you, or to a member of the stranger’s family,  [48] after he is sold he may be redeemed. One of his brothers may redeem him;  [49] or his uncle, or his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or any who is a close relative to him of his family may redeem him; or if he has grown rich, he may redeem himself.  [50] He shall reckon with him who bought him from the year that he sold himself to him to the Year of Jubilee. The price of his sale shall be according to the number of years; he shall be with him according to the time of a hired servant.  [51] If there are yet many years, according to them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.  [52] If there remain but a few years to the year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him; according to his years of service he shall give back the price of his redemption.  [53] As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him. He shall not rule with harshness over him in your sight.  [54] If he isn’t redeemed by these means, then he shall be released in the Year of Jubilee: he and his children with him.  [55] For to me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt. I am Yahweh your God.\n"

Even then the land will rest and enjoy its Sabbaths.  [35] As long as it lies desolate it shall have rest, even the rest which it didn’t have in your Sabbaths when you lived on it.\n     [36] “‘As for those of you who are left, I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies. The sound of a driven leaf will put them to flight; and they shall flee, as one flees from the sword. They will fall when no one pursues.  [37] They will stumble over one another, as it were before the sword, when no one pursues. You will have no power to stand before your enemies.  [38] You will perish among the nations.

It shall be owned by the priests.\n     [22] “‘If He dedicates a field to Yahweh which He has bought, which is not of the field of His possession,  [23] then the priest shall reckon to Him the worth of your valuation up to the Year of Jubilee; and He shall give your valuation on that day, as a holy thing to Yahweh.

They shall carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings; and they shall take care of it, and shall encamp around it.  [51] When the tabernacle is to move, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be set up, the Levites shall set it up. The stranger who comes near shall be put to death.  [52] The children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, according to their divisions.  [53] But the Levites shall encamp around the Tabernacle of the Testimony, that there may be no wrath on the congregation of the children of Israel. The Levites shall be responsible for the Tabernacle of the Testimony.”\n     [54] Thus the children of Israel did. According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so they did.\n"

The outsider who comes near shall be put to death.  [39] All who were counted of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron counted at the commandment of Yahweh, by their families, all the males from a month old and upward, were twenty-two thousand.\n     [40] Yahweh said to Moses, “Count all the firstborn males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names.  [41] You shall take the Levites for me—I am Yahweh—instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the livestock of the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the livestock of the children of Israel.”\n     [42] Moses counted, as Yahweh commanded Him, all the firstborn among the children of Israel.  [43] All the firstborn males according to the number of names from a month old and upward, of those who were counted of them, were twenty-two thousand two hundred seventy-three.\n     [44] Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  [45] “Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the livestock of the Levites instead of their livestock; and the Levites shall be mine. I am Yahweh.  [46] For the redemption of the two hundred seventy-three of the firstborn of the children of Israel who exceed the number of the Levites,  [47] you shall take five shekels apiece for each one; according to the shekel of the sanctuary you shall take them (the shekel is twenty gerahs);  [48] and you shall give the money, with which their remainder is redeemed, to Aaron and to his sons.”\n     [49] Moses took the redemption money from those who exceeded the number of those who were redeemed by the Levites;  [50] from the firstborn of the children of Israel he took the money, one thousand three hundred sixty-five shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary;  [51] and Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and to His sons, according to Yahweh’s word, as Yahweh commanded Moses.\n"

He lit its lamps to light the area in front of the lamp stand, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  [4] This was the workmanship of the lamp stand, beaten work of gold. From its base to its flowers, it was beaten work. He made the lamp stand according to the pattern which Yahweh had shown Moses.\n     [5] Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  [6] “Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them.  [7] You shall do this to them to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of cleansing on them, let them shave their whole bodies with a razor, let them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves.  [8] Then let them take a young bull and its meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil; and another young bull you shall take for a sin offering.  [9] You shall present the Levites before the Tent of Meeting. You shall assemble the whole congregation of the children of Israel.  [10] You shall present the Levites before Yahweh. The children of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites,  [11] and Aaron shall offer the Levites before Yahweh for a wave offering on the behalf of the children of Israel, that it may be theirs to do the service of Yahweh.\n     [12] “The Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, and you shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering to Yahweh, to make atonement for the Levites.

[14] Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the children of Israel, and the Levites shall be mine.\n     [15] “After that, the Levites shall go in to do the service of the Tent of Meeting. You shall cleanse them, and offer them as a wave offering.  [16] For they are wholly given to me from among the children of Israel; instead of all who open the womb, even the firstborn of all the children of Israel, I have taken them to me.  [17] For all the firstborn among the children of Israel are mine, both man and animal. On the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them for myself.  [18] I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel.  [19] I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the Tent of Meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Israel, so that there will be no plague among the children of Israel when the children of Israel come near to the sanctuary.”\n     [20] Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel did so to the Levites. According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so the children of Israel did to them.  [21] The Levites purified themselves from sin, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them for a wave offering before Yahweh and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them.  [22] After that, the Levites went in to do their service in the Tent of Meeting before Aaron and before His sons: as Yahweh had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them.\n     [23] Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  [24] “This is what is assigned to the Levites: from twenty-five years old and upward they shall go in to wait on the service in the work of the Tent of Meeting;  [25] and from the age of fifty years they shall retire from doing the work, and shall serve no more,  [26] but shall assist their brothers in the Tent of Meeting, to perform the duty, and shall perform no service. This is how you shall have the Levites do their duties.”\n"

[3] On the fourteenth day of this month, at evening, you shall keep it in its appointed season. You shall keep it according to all its statutes and according to all its ordinances.”\n     [4] Moses told the children of Israel that they should keep the Passover.  [5] They kept the Passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, in the wilderness of Sinai. According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did.  [6] There were certain men who were unclean because of the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day, and they came before Moses and Aaron on that day.  [7] Those men said to Him, “We are unclean because of the dead body of a man. Why are we kept back, that we may not offer the offering of Yahweh in its appointed season among the children of Israel?”\n     [8] Moses answered them, “Wait, that I may hear what Yahweh will command concerning you.”\n     [9] Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  [10] “Say to the children of Israel, ‘If any man of you or of your generations is unclean by reason of a dead body, or is on a journey far away, He shall still keep the Passover to Yahweh.  [11] In the second month, on the fourteenth day at evening they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.  [12] They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor break a bone of it. According to all the statute of the Passover they shall keep it.  [13] But the man who is clean, and is not on a journey, and fails to keep the Passover, that soul shall be cut off from His people. Because He didn’t offer the offering of Yahweh in its appointed season, that man shall bear His sin.\n     [14] “‘If a foreigner lives among you and desires to keep the Passover to Yahweh, then He shall do so according to the statute of the Passover, and according to its ordinance. You shall have one statute, both for the foreigner and for Him who is born in the land.’”\n     [15] On the day that the tabernacle was raised up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the Tent of the Testimony. At evening it was over the tabernacle, as it were the appearance of fire, until morning.  [16] So it was continually. The cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night.  [17] Whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel traveled; and in the place where the cloud remained, there the children of Israel encamped.  [18] At the commandment of Yahweh, the children of Israel traveled, and at the commandment of Yahweh they encamped. As long as the cloud remained on the tabernacle they remained encamped.  [19] When the cloud stayed on the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept Yahweh’s command, and didn’t travel.  [20] Sometimes the cloud was a few days on the tabernacle; then according to the commandment of Yahweh they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of Yahweh they traveled.  [21] Sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they traveled; or by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they traveled.  [22] Whether it was two days, or a month, or a year that the cloud stayed on the tabernacle, remaining on it, the children of Israel remained encamped, and didn’t travel; but when it was taken up, they traveled.

[16] Eliab the son of Helon was over the army of the tribe of the children of Zebulun.  [17] The tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who bore the tabernacle, went forward.

Elishama the son of Ammihud was over his army.  [23] Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur was over the army of the tribe of the children of Manasseh.  [24] Abidan the son of Gideoni was over the army of the tribe of the children of Benjamin.\n     [25] The standard of the camp of the children of Dan, which was the rear guard of all the camps, set forward according to their armies.

[32] It shall be, if you go with us—yes, it shall be—that whatever good Yahweh does to us, we will do the same to you.”\n     [33] They set forward from the Mount of Yahweh three days’ journey. The ark of Yahweh’s covenant went before them three days’ journey, to seek out a resting place for them.  [34] The cloud of Yahweh was over them by day, when they set forward from the camp.  [35] When the ark went forward, Moses said, “Rise up, Yahweh, and let your enemies be scattered! Let those who hate you flee before you!”  [36] When it rested, He said, “Return, Yahweh, to the ten thousands of the thousands of Israel.”\n"

When Yahweh heard it, His anger burned; and Yahweh’s fire burned among them, and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp.  [2] The people cried to Moses; and Moses prayed to Yahweh, and the fire abated.  [3] The name of that place was called Taberah, because Yahweh’s fire burned among them.\n     [4] The mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly; and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, “Who will give us meat to eat?  [5] We remember the fish, which we ate in Egypt for nothing; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic;  [6] but now we have lost our appetite. There is nothing at all except this manna to look at.”  [7] The manna was like coriander seed, and it looked like bdellium.  [8] The people went around, gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it. Its taste was like the taste of fresh oil.  [9] When the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna fell on it.\n     [10] Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of His tent; and Yahweh’s anger burned greatly; and Moses was displeased.  [11] Moses said to Yahweh, “Why have you treated your servant so badly? Why haven’t I found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me?  [12] Have I conceived all this people? Have I brought them out, that you should tell me, ‘Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries a nursing infant, to the land which you swore to their fathers?’  [13] Where could I get meat to give all these people? For they weep before me, saying, ‘Give us meat, that we may eat.’  [14] I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.  [15] If you treat me this way, please kill me right now, if I have found favor in your sight; and don’t let me see my wretchedness.”\n     [16] Yahweh said to Moses, “Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and officers over them; and bring them to the Tent of Meeting, that they may stand there with you.  [17] I will come down and talk with you there. I will take of the Spirit which is on you, and will put it on them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you don’t bear it yourself alone.\n     [18] “Say to the people, ‘Sanctify yourselves in preparation for tomorrow, and you will eat meat; for you have wept in the ears of Yahweh, saying, “Who will give us meat to eat? For it was well with us in Egypt.” Therefore Yahweh will give you meat, and you will eat.  [19] You will not eat just one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days,  [20] but a whole month, until it comes out at your nostrils, and it is loathsome to you; because you have rejected Yahweh who is among you, and have wept before Him, saying, “Why did we come out of Egypt?”’”\n     [21] Moses said, “The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand men on foot; and you have said, ‘I will give them meat, that they may eat a whole month.’  [22] Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to be sufficient for them? Shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to be sufficient for them?”\n     [23] Yahweh said to Moses, “Has Yahweh’s hand grown short? Now you will see whether my word will happen to you or not.”\n     [24] Moses went out, and told the people Yahweh’s words; and He gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them around the Tent.  [25] Yahweh came down in the cloud, and spoke to Him, and took of the Spirit that was on Him, and put it on the seventy elders. When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied, but they did so no more.  [26] But two men remained in the camp. The name of one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad; and the Spirit rested on them. They were of those who were written, but had not gone out to the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp.  [27] A young man ran, and told Moses, and said, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp!”\n     [28] Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered, “My lord Moses, forbid them!”\n     [29] Moses said to Him, “Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all Yahweh’s people were prophets, that Yahweh would put His Spirit on them!”\n     [30] Moses went into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.  [31] A wind from Yahweh went out and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day’s journey on this side, and a day’s journey on the other side, around the camp, and about two cubits above the surface of the earth.  [32] The people rose up all that day, and all of that night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails. He who gathered least gathered ten homers; and they spread them all out for themselves around the camp.  [33] While the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, Yahweh’s anger burned against the people, and Yahweh struck the people with a very great plague.  [34] The name of that place was called Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people who lusted.\n     [35] From Kibroth Hattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth; and they stayed at Hazeroth.\n"

[26] They went and came to Moses, to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them and to all the congregation. They showed them the fruit of the land.  [27] They told him, and said, “We came to the land where you sent us. Surely it flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit.  [28] However, the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large. Moreover, we saw the children of Anak there.  [29] Amalek dwells in the land of the South. The Hittite, the Jebusite, and the Amorite dwell in the hill country. The Canaanite dwells by the sea, and along the side of the Jordan.”\n     [30] Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, “Let’s go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it!”\n     [31] But the men who went up with him said, “We aren’t able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.”  [32] They brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out to the children of Israel, saying, “The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eats up its inhabitants; and all the people who we saw in it are men of great stature.  [33] There we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come from the Nephilim. We were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.”\n"

The whole congregation said to them, “We wish that we had died in the land of Egypt, or that we had died in this wilderness!  [3] Why does Yahweh bring us to this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will be captured or killed! Wouldn’t it be better for us to return into Egypt?”  [4] They said to one another, “Let’s choose a leader, and let’s return into Egypt.”\n     [5] Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.\n     [6] Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of those who spied out the land, tore their clothes.  [7] They spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, “The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceedingly good land.  [8] If Yahweh delights in us, then He will bring us into this land, and give it to us: a land which flows with milk and honey.  [9] Only don’t rebel against Yahweh, neither fear the people of the land; for they are bread for us. Their defense is removed from over them, and Yahweh is with us. Don’t fear them.”\n     [10] But all the congregation threatened to stone them with stones.\n    Yahweh’s glory appeared in the Tent of Meeting to all the children of Israel.  [11] Yahweh said to Moses, “How long will this people despise me? How long will they not believe in me, for all the signs which I have worked among them?  [12] I will strike them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they.”\n     [13] Moses said to Yahweh, “Then the Egyptians will hear it; for you brought up this people in your might from among them.  [14] They will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that you Yahweh are among this people; for you Yahweh are seen face to face, and your cloud stands over them, and you go before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night.  [15] Now if you killed this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of you will speak, saying,  [16] ‘Because Yahweh was not able to bring this people into the land which He swore to them, therefore He has slain them in the wilderness.’  [17] Now please let the power of the Lord be great, according as you have spoken, saying,  [18] ‘Yahweh is slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, forgiving iniquity and disobedience; and He will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and on the fourth generation.’  [19] Please pardon the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your loving kindness, and just as you have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.”\n     [20] Yahweh said, “I have pardoned according to your word;  [21] but in very deed—as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with Yahweh’s glory—  [22] because all those men who have seen my glory and my signs, which I worked in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have tempted me these ten times, and have not listened to my voice;  [23] surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers, neither shall any of those who despised me see it.  [24] But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and has followed me fully, him I will bring into the land into which he went. His offspring shall possess it.  [25] Since the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley, tomorrow turn and go into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.”  [26] Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,  [27] “How long shall I bear with this evil congregation that complain against me? I have heard the complaints of the children of Israel, which they complain against me.  [28] Tell them, ‘As I live, says Yahweh, surely as you have spoken in my ears, so I will do to you.  [29] Your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness; and all who were counted of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, who have complained against me,  [30] surely you shall not come into the land concerning which I swore that I would make you dwell therein, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.  [31] But I will bring in your little ones that you said should be captured or killed, and they shall know the land which you have rejected.  [32] But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness.  [33] Your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your prostitution, until your dead bodies are consumed in the wilderness.  [34] After the number of the days in which you spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, you will bear your iniquities, even forty years, and you will know my alienation.’  [35] I, Yahweh, have spoken. I will surely do this to all this evil congregation who are gathered together against me. In this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.”\n     [36] The men whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned and made all the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up an evil report against the land,  [37] even those men who brought up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before Yahweh.  [38] But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh remained alive of those men who went to spy out the land.\n     [39] Moses told these words to all the children of Israel, and the people mourned greatly.  [40] They rose up early in the morning and went up to the top of the mountain, saying, “Behold, we are here, and will go up to the place which Yahweh has promised; for we have sinned.”\n     [41] Moses said, “Why now do you disobey the commandment of Yahweh, since it shall not prosper?  [42] Don’t go up, for Yahweh isn’t among you; that way you won’t be struck down before your enemies.  [43] For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you, and you will fall by the sword because you turned back from following Yahweh; therefore Yahweh will not be with you.”\n     [44] But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain. Nevertheless, the ark of Yahweh’s covenant and Moses didn’t depart out of the camp.  [45] Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites who lived in that mountain, and struck them and beat them down even to Hormah.\n"

[11] Thus it shall be done for each bull, for each ram, for each of the male lambs, or of the young goats.  [12] According to the number that you shall prepare, so you shall do to everyone according to their number.\n     [13] “‘All who are native-born shall do these things in this way, in offering an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.

[21] Of the first of your dough, you shall give to Yahweh a wave offering throughout your generations.\n     [22] “‘When you err, and don’t observe all these commandments which Yahweh has spoken to Moses—  [23] even all that Yahweh has commanded you by Moses, from the day that Yahweh gave commandment and onward throughout your generations—  [24] then it shall be, if it was done unwittingly, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bull for a burnt offering, for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh, with its meal offering and its drink offering, according to the ordinance, and one male goat for a sin offering.  [25] The priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought their offering, an offering made by fire to Yahweh, and their sin offering before Yahweh, for their error.

[2] They rose up before Moses, with some of the children of Israel, two hundred fifty princes of the congregation, called to the assembly, men of renown.  [3] They assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, “You take too much on yourself, since all the congregation are holy, everyone of them, and Yahweh is among them! Why do you lift yourselves up above Yahweh’s assembly?”\n     [4] When Moses heard it, he fell on his face.  [5] He said to Korah and to all His company, “In the morning, Yahweh will show who are His, and who is holy, and will cause Him to come near to Him. Even Him whom He shall choose, He will cause to come near to Him.  [6] Do this: have Korah and all his company take censers,  [7] put fire in them, and put incense on them before Yahweh tomorrow. It shall be that the man whom Yahweh chooses, He shall be holy. You have gone too far, you sons of Levi!”\n     [8] Moses said to Korah, “Hear now, you sons of Levi!  [9] Is it a small thing to you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to Himself, to do the service of Yahweh’s tabernacle, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them;  [10] and that he has brought you near, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you? Do you seek the priesthood also?  [11] Therefore you and all your company have gathered together against Yahweh! What is Aaron that you complain against Him?”\n     [12] Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; and they said, “We won’t come up!  [13] Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but you must also make yourself a prince over us?  [14] Moreover you haven’t brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you put out the eyes of these men? We won’t come up.”\n     [15] Moses was very angry, and said to Yahweh, “Don’t respect their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them, neither have I hurt one of them.”\n     [16] Moses said to Korah, “You and all your company go before Yahweh, you, and they, and Aaron, tomorrow.  [17] Each man take His censer and put incense on it, and each man bring before Yahweh His censer, two hundred fifty censers; you also, and Aaron, each with His censer.”\n     [18] They each took his censer, and put fire in it, and laid incense on it, and stood at the door of the Tent of Meeting with Moses and Aaron.  [19] Korah assembled all the congregation opposite them to the door of the Tent of Meeting.\n    Yahweh’s glory appeared to all the congregation.  [20] Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,  [21] “Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment!”\n     [22] They fell on their faces, and said, “God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will you be angry with all the congregation?”\n     [23] Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  [24] “Speak to the congregation, saying, ‘Get away from around the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram!’”\n     [25] Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.  [26] He spoke to the congregation, saying, “Depart, please, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins!”\n     [27] So they went away from the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side. Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents with their wives, their sons, and their little ones.\n     [28] Moses said, “Hereby you shall know that Yahweh has sent me to do all these works; for they are not from my own mind.  [29] If these men die the common death of all men, or if they experience what all men experience, then Yahweh hasn’t sent me.  [30] But if Yahweh makes a new thing, and the ground opens its mouth, and swallows them up with all that belong to them, and they go down alive into Sheol, then you shall understand that these men have despised Yahweh.”\n     [31] As he finished speaking all these words, the ground that was under them split apart.  [32] The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up with their households, all of Korah’s men, and all their goods.  [33] So they, and all that belonged to them went down alive into Sheol. The earth closed on them, and they perished from among the assembly.  [34] All Israel that were around them fled at their cry; for they said, “Lest the earth swallow us up!”  [35] Fire came out from Yahweh, and devoured the two hundred fifty men who offered the incense.\n     [36] Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  [37] “Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter the fire away from the camp; for they are holy,  [38] even the censers of those who sinned against their own lives. Let them be beaten into plates for a covering of the altar, for they offered them before Yahweh. Therefore they are holy. They shall be a sign to the children of Israel.”\n     [39] Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers which those who were burned had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar,  [40] to be a memorial to the children of Israel, to the end that no stranger who isn’t of the offspring of Aaron, would come near to burn incense before Yahweh, that He not be as Korah and as His company; as Yahweh spoke to Him by Moses.\n     [41] But on the next day all the congregation of the children of Israel complained against Moses and against Aaron, saying, “You have killed Yahweh’s people!”\n     [42] When the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, they looked toward the Tent of Meeting. Behold, the cloud covered it, and Yahweh’s glory appeared.  [43] Moses and Aaron came to the front of the Tent of Meeting.  [44] Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  [45] “Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment!” They fell on their faces.\n     [46] Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer, put fire from the altar in it, lay incense on it, carry it quickly to the congregation, and make atonement for them; for wrath has gone out from Yahweh! The plague has begun.”\n     [47] Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the middle of the assembly. The plague had already begun among the people. He put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.  [48] He stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.  [49] Now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred, in addition to those who died about the matter of Korah.  [50] Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and the plague was stopped.\n"

[5] One shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her meat, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn.  [6] The priest shall take cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the middle of the burning of the heifer.  [7] Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the evening.  [8] He who burns her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the evening.\n     [9] “A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up outside of the camp in a clean place; and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for use in water for cleansing impurity. It is a sin offering.  [10] He who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening. It shall be to the children of Israel, and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them, for a statute forever.\n     [11] “He who touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.  [12] He shall purify himself with water on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean; but if he doesn’t purify himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.  [13] Whoever touches a dead person, the body of a man who has died, and doesn’t purify Himself, defiles Yahweh’s tabernacle; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel; because the water for impurity was not sprinkled on Him, He shall be unclean. His uncleanness is yet on Him.\n     [14] “This is the law when a man dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent, and everyone who is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.  [15] Every open vessel, which has no covering bound on it, is unclean.\n     [16] “Whoever in the open field touches one who is slain with a sword, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.\n     [17] “For the unclean, they shall take of the ashes of the burning of the sin offering; and running water shall be poured on them in a vessel.  [18] A clean person shall take hyssop, dip it in the water, and sprinkle it on the tent, on all the vessels, on the persons who were there, and on him who touched the bone, or the slain, or the dead, or the grave.  [19] The clean person shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day. On the seventh day, he shall purify him. He shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at evening.  [20] But the man who shall be unclean, and shall not purify Himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the assembly, because He has defiled the sanctuary of Yahweh. The water for impurity has not been sprinkled on Him. He is unclean.  [21] It shall be a perpetual statute to them. He who sprinkles the water for impurity shall wash his clothes, and he who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until evening.\n     [22] “Whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean; and the soul that touches it shall be unclean until evening.”\n"

Miriam died there, and was buried there.  [2] There was no water for the congregation; and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.  [3] The people quarreled with Moses, and spoke, saying, “We wish that we had died when our brothers died before Yahweh!  [4] Why have you brought Yahweh’s assembly into this wilderness, that we should die there, we and our animals?  [5] Why have you made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in to this evil place? It is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.”\n     [6] Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and fell on their faces. Yahweh’s glory appeared to them.  [7] Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  [8] “Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, you, and Aaron your brother, and speak to the rock before their eyes, that it pour out its water. You shall bring water to them out of the rock; so you shall give the congregation and their livestock drink.”\n     [9] Moses took the rod from before Yahweh, as He commanded Him.  [10] Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said to them, “Hear now, you rebels! Shall we bring water out of this rock for you?”  [11] Moses lifted up his hand, and struck the rock with his rod twice, and water came out abundantly. The congregation and their livestock drank.\n     [12] Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you didn’t believe in me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.”\n     [13] These are the waters of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with Yahweh, and He was sanctified in them.\n     [14] Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, saying:\n    “Your brother Israel says: You know all the travail that has happened to us;  [15] how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we lived in Egypt a long time. The Egyptians mistreated us and our fathers.  [16] When we cried to Yahweh, He heard our voice, sent an angel, and brought us out of Egypt. Behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the edge of your border.\n     [17] “Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink from the water of the wells. We will go along the king’s highway. We will not turn away to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed your border.”\n     [18] Edom said to him, “You shall not pass through me, lest I come out with the sword against you.”\n     [19] The children of Israel said to him, “We will go up by the highway; and if we drink your water, I and my livestock, then I will give its price. Only let me, without doing anything else, pass through on my feet.”\n     [20] He said, “You shall not pass through.” Edom came out against him with many people, and with a strong hand.  [21] Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border, so Israel turned away from him.\n     [22] They traveled from Kadesh, and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor.  [23] Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying,  [24] “Aaron shall be gathered to his people; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because you rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah.  [25] Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to Mount Hor;  [26] and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son. Aaron shall be gathered, and shall die there.”\n     [27] Moses did as Yahweh commanded. They went up onto Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.  [28] Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son. Aaron died there on the top of the mountain, and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.  [29] When all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.\n"

[2] Israel vowed a vow to Yahweh, and said, “If you will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.”  [3] Yahweh listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities. The name of the place was called Hormah.\n     [4] They traveled from Mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom. The soul of the people was very discouraged because of the journey.  [5] The people spoke against God and against Moses: “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread, there is no water, and our soul loathes this disgusting food!”\n     [6] Yahweh sent venomous snakes among the people, and they bit the people. Many people of Israel died.  [7] The people came to Moses, and said, “We have sinned, because we have spoken against Yahweh and against you. Pray to Yahweh, that He take away the serpents from us.” Moses prayed for the people.\n     [8] Yahweh said to Moses, “Make a venomous snake, and set it on a pole. It shall happen that everyone who is bitten, when He sees it, shall live.”  [9] Moses made a serpent of bronze, and set it on the pole. If a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked at the serpent of bronze, he lived.\n     [10] The children of Israel traveled, and encamped in Oboth.  [11] They traveled from Oboth, and encamped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrise.  [12] From there they traveled, and encamped in the valley of Zered.  [13] From there they traveled, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the border of the Amorites; for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.  [14] Therefore it is said in The Book of the Wars of Yahweh, “Vaheb in Suphah, the valleys of the Arnon,  [15] the slope of the valleys that incline toward the dwelling of Ar, leans on the border of Moab.”\n     [16] From there they traveled to Beer; that is the well of which Yahweh said to Moses, “Gather the people together, and I will give them water.”\n     [17] Then Israel sang this song:\n  “Spring up, well! Sing to it,\n     [18] the well, which the princes dug,\n    which the nobles of the people dug,\n    with the scepter, and with their poles.”\n    From the wilderness they traveled to Mattanah;  [19] and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;  [20] and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks down on the desert.  [21] Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,  [22] “Let me pass through your land. We will not turn away into field or vineyard. We will not drink of the water of the wells. We will go by the king’s highway, until we have passed your border.”\n     [23] Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border, but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz. He fought against Israel.  [24] Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was fortified.  [25] Israel took all these cities. Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its villages.  [26] For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to the Arnon.  [27] Therefore those who speak in proverbs say,\n  “Come to Heshbon.\n    Let the city of Sihon be built and established;\n   [28] for a fire has gone out of Heshbon,\n    a flame from the city of Sihon.\n  It has devoured Ar of Moab,\n    The lords of the high places of the Arnon.\n   [29] Woe to you, Moab!\n    You are undone, people of Chemosh!\n  He has given his sons as fugitives,\n    and his daughters into captivity,\n    to Sihon king of the Amorites.\n   [30] We have shot at them.\n    Heshbon has perished even to Dibon.\n  We have laid waste even to Nophah,\n    Which reaches to Medeba.”\n     [31] Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.  [32] Moses sent to spy out Jazer. They took its villages, and drove out the Amorites who were there.  [33] They turned and went up by the way of Bashan. Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.\n     [34] Yahweh said to Moses, “Don’t fear Him, for I have delivered Him into your hand, with all His people, and His land. You shall do to Him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.”\n     [35] So they struck him, with his sons and all his people, until there were no survivors; and they possessed his land.\n"

[2] Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.  [3] Moab was very afraid of the people, because they were many. Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.  [4] Moab said to the elders of Midian, “Now this multitude will lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field.”\n    Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.  [5] He sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, “Behold, there is a people who came out of Egypt. Behold, they cover the surface of the earth, and they are staying opposite me.  [6] Please come now therefore, and curse this people for me; for they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I shall prevail, that we may strike them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.”\n     [7] The elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand. They came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak.\n     [8] He said to them, “Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as Yahweh shall speak to me.” The princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.\n     [9] God came to Balaam, and said, “Who are these men with you?”\n     [10] Balaam said to God, “Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has said to me,  [11] ‘Behold, the people that has come out of Egypt covers the surface of the earth. Now, come curse them for me. Perhaps I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.’”\n     [12] God said to Balaam, “You shall not go with them. You shall not curse the people, for they are blessed.”\n     [13] Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, “Go to your land; for Yahweh refuses to permit me to go with you.”\n     [14] The princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, “Balaam refuses to come with us.”\n     [15] Balak again sent princes, more, and more honorable than they.  [16] They came to Balaam, and said to him, “Balak the son of Zippor says, ‘Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me,  [17] for I will promote you to very great honor, and whatever you say to me I will do. Please come therefore, and curse this people for me.’”\n     [18] Balaam answered the servants of Balak, “If Balak would give me His house full of silver and gold, I can’t go beyond the word of Yahweh my God, to do less or more.  [19] Now therefore please stay here tonight as well, that I may know what else Yahweh will speak to me.”\n     [20] God came to Balaam at night, and said to Him, “If the men have come to call you, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak to you, that you shall do.”\n     [21] Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab.  [22] God’s anger burned because He went; and Yahweh’s angel placed Himself in the way as an adversary against Him. Now He was riding on His donkey, and His two servants were with Him.  [23] The donkey saw Yahweh’s angel standing in the way, with His sword drawn in His hand; and the donkey turned out of the path, and went into the field. Balaam struck the donkey, to turn her into the path.  [24] Then Yahweh’s angel stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.  [25] The donkey saw Yahweh’s angel, and she thrust herself to the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall. He struck her again.\n     [26] Yahweh’s angel went further, and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.  [27] The donkey saw Yahweh’s angel, and she lay down under Balaam. Balaam’s anger burned, and He struck the donkey with His staff.\n     [28] Yahweh opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, “What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?”\n     [29] Balaam said to the donkey, “Because you have mocked me, I wish there were a sword in my hand, for now I would have killed you.”\n     [30] The donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden all your life long until today? Was I ever in the habit of doing so to you?”\n    He said, “No.”\n     [31] Then Yahweh opened the eyes of Balaam, and He saw Yahweh’s angel standing in the way, with His sword drawn in His hand; and He bowed His head, and fell on His face.  [32] Yahweh’s angel said to Him, “Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out as an adversary, because your way is perverse before me.  [33] The donkey saw me, and turned away before me these three times. Unless she had turned away from me, surely now I would have killed you, and saved her alive.”\n     [34] Balaam said to Yahweh’s angel, “I have sinned; for I didn’t know that you stood in the way against me. Now therefore, if it displeases you, I will go back again.”\n     [35] Yahweh’s angel said to Balaam, “Go with the men; but you shall only speak the word that I shall speak to you.”\n    So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.  [36] When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him to the City of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border.  [37] Balak said to Balaam, “Didn’t I earnestly send for you to summon you? Why didn’t you come to me? Am I not able indeed to promote you to honor?”\n     [38] Balaam said to Balak, “Behold, I have come to you. Have I now any power at all to speak anything? I will speak the word that God puts in my mouth.”\n     [39] Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath Huzoth.  [40] Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes who were with him.  [41] In the morning, Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal; and he saw from there part of the people.\n"

[4] Yahweh said to Moses, “Take all the chiefs of the people, and hang them up to Yahweh before the sun, that the fierce anger of Yahweh may turn away from Israel.”\n     [5] Moses said to the judges of Israel, “Everyone kill his men who have joined themselves to Baal Peor.”\n     [6] Behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought to his brothers a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, while they were weeping at the door of the Tent of Meeting.  [7] When Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from the middle of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand.  [8] He went after the man of Israel into the pavilion, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her body. So the plague was stopped among the children of Israel.  [9] Those who died by the plague were twenty-four thousand.\n     [10] Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  [11] “Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I didn’t consume the children of Israel in my jealousy.  [12] Therefore say, ‘Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace.  [13] It shall be to Him, and to His offspring after Him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood, because He was jealous for His God, and made atonement for the children of Israel.’”\n     [14] Now the name of the man of Israel that was slain, who was slain with the Midianite woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a fathers’ house among the Simeonites.  [15] The name of the Midianite woman who was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur. He was head of the people of a fathers’ house in Midian.\n     [16] Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  [17] “Harass the Midianites, and strike them;  [18] for they harassed you with their wiles, wherein they have deceived you in the matter of Peor, and in the incident regarding Cozbi, the daughter of the prince of Midian, their sister, who was slain on the day of the plague in the matter of Peor.”\n"

[20] You shall purify every garment, and all that is made of skin, and all work of goats’ hair, and all things made of wood.”\n     [21] Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who went to the battle, “This is the statute of the law which Yahweh has commanded Moses.  [22] However the gold, and the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin, and the lead,  [23] everything that may withstand the fire, you shall make to go through the fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless it shall be purified with the water for impurity. All that doesn’t withstand the fire you shall make to go through the water.  [24] You shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean. Afterward you shall come into the camp.”\n     [25] Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  [26] “Count the plunder that was taken, both of man and of animal, you, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers’ households of the congregation;  [27] and divide the plunder into two parts: between the men skilled in war, who went out to battle, and all the congregation.  [28] Levy a tribute to Yahweh of the men of war who went out to battle: one soul of five hundred; of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys, and of the flocks.  [29] Take it from their half, and give it to Eleazar the priest, for Yahweh’s wave offering.  [30] Of the children of Israel’s half, you shall take one drawn out of every fifty, of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys, and of the flocks, of all the livestock, and give them to the Levites, who perform the duty of Yahweh’s tabernacle.”\n     [31] Moses and Eleazar the priest did as Yahweh commanded Moses.\n     [32] Now the plunder, over and above the booty which the men of war took, was six hundred seventy-five thousand sheep,  [33] seventy-two thousand head of cattle,  [34] sixty-one thousand donkeys,  [35] and thirty-two thousand persons in all, of the women who had not known man by lying with him.  [36] The half, which was the portion of those who went out to war, was in number three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep;  [37] and Yahweh’s tribute of the sheep was six hundred seventy-five.  [38] The cattle were thirty-six thousand, of which Yahweh’s tribute was seventy-two.  [39] The donkeys were thirty thousand five hundred, of which Yahweh’s tribute was sixty-one.  [40] The persons were sixteen thousand, of whom Yahweh’s tribute was thirty-two persons.  [41] Moses gave the tribute, which was Yahweh’s wave offering, to Eleazar the priest, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  [42] Of the children of Israel’s half, which Moses divided off from the men who fought  [43] (now the congregation’s half was three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep,  [44] thirty-six thousand head of cattle,  [45] thirty thousand five hundred donkeys,  [46] and sixteen thousand persons),  [47] even of the children of Israel’s half, Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of animal, and gave them to the Levites, who performed the duty of Yahweh’s tabernacle, as Yahweh commanded Moses.\n     [48] The officers who were over the thousands of the army, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, came near to Moses.  [49] They said to Moses, “Your servants have taken the sum of the men of war who are under our command, and there lacks not one man of us.  [50] We have brought Yahweh’s offering, what every man found: gold ornaments, armlets, bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and necklaces, to make atonement for our souls before Yahweh.”\n     [51] Moses and Eleazar the priest took their gold, even all worked jewels.  [52] All the gold of the wave offering that they offered up to Yahweh, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred fifty shekels.  [53] The men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.  [54] Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the Tent of Meeting for a memorial for the children of Israel before Yahweh.\n"

Behold, the place was a place for livestock.  [2] Then the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the princes of the congregation, saying,  [3] “Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon,  [4] the land which Yahweh struck before the congregation of Israel, is a land for livestock; and your servants have livestock.”  [5] They said, “If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for a possession. Don’t bring us over the Jordan.”\n     [6] Moses said to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, “Shall your brothers go to war while you sit here?  [7] Why do you discourage the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which Yahweh has given them?  [8] Your fathers did so when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to see the land.  [9] For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which Yahweh had given them.  [10] Yahweh’s anger burned in that day, and He swore, saying,  [11] ‘Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me,  [12] except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun, because they have followed Yahweh completely.’  [13] Yahweh’s anger burned against Israel, and He made them wander back and forth in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation who had done evil in Yahweh’s sight was consumed.\n     [14] “Behold, you have risen up in your fathers’ place, an increase of sinful men, to increase the fierce anger of Yahweh toward Israel.  [15] For if you turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and you will destroy all these people.”\n     [16] They came near to him, and said, “We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock, and cities for our little ones;  [17] but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel, until we have brought them to their place. Our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.  [18] We will not return to our houses until the children of Israel have all received their inheritance.  [19] For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance has come to us on this side of the Jordan eastward.”\n     [20] Moses said to them: “If you will do this thing, if you will arm yourselves to go before Yahweh to the war,  [21] and every one of your armed men will pass over the Jordan before Yahweh until He has driven out His enemies from before Him,  [22] and the land is subdued before Yahweh; then afterward you shall return, and be clear of obligation to Yahweh and to Israel. Then this land shall be your possession before Yahweh.\n     [23] “But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against Yahweh; and be sure your sin will find you out.  [24] Build cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth.”\n     [25] The children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, “Your servants will do as my lord commands.  [26] Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our livestock shall be there in the cities of Gilead;  [27] but your servants will pass over, every man who is armed for war, before Yahweh to battle, as my lord says.”\n     [28] So Moses commanded concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers’ households of the tribes of the children of Israel.  [29] Moses said to them, “If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every man who is armed to battle before Yahweh, and the land is subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession;  [30] but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.”\n     [31] The children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, “As Yahweh has said to your servants, so will we do.  [32] We will pass over armed before Yahweh into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond the Jordan.”\n     [33] Moses gave to them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan; the land, according to its cities and borders, even the cities of the surrounding land.  [34] The children of Gad built Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,  [35] Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,  [36] Beth Nimrah, and Beth Haran: fortified cities and folds for sheep.  [37] The children of Reuben built Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim,  [38] Nebo, and Baal Meon, (their names being changed), and Sibmah. They gave other names to the cities which they built.  [39] The children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, took it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were therein.  [40] Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh; and he lived therein.  [41] Jair the son of Manasseh went and took its villages, and called them Havvoth Jair.  [42] Nobah went and took Kenath and its villages, and called it Nobah, after his own name.\n"

[13] Take wise men of understanding who are respected among your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.”\n     [14] You answered me, and said, “The thing which you have spoken is good to do.”  [15] So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and respected men, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, captains of hundreds, captains of fifties, captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes.  [16] I commanded your judges at that time, saying, “Hear cases between your brothers and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the foreigner who is living with him.  [17] You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike. You shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is God’s. The case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.”  [18] I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do.  [19] We traveled from Horeb and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw, by the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as Yahweh our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh Barnea.  [20] I said to you, “You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which Yahweh our God gives to us.  [21] Behold, Yahweh your God has set the land before you. Go up, take possession, as Yahweh the God of your fathers has spoken to you. Don’t be afraid, neither be dismayed.”\n     [22] You came near to me, everyone of you, and said, “Let’s send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring back to us word of the way by which we must go up, and the cities to which we shall come.”\n     [23] The thing pleased me well. I took twelve of your men, one man for every tribe.  [24] They turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.  [25] They took some of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, “It is a good land which Yahweh our God gives to us.”\n     [26] Yet you wouldn’t go up, but rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God.  [27] You murmured in your tents, and said, “Because Yahweh hated us, He has brought us out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us.  [28] Where are we going up? Our brothers have made our heart melt, saying, ‘The people are greater and taller than we. The cities are great and fortified up to the sky. Moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there!’”\n     [29] Then I said to you, “Don’t be terrified. Don’t be afraid of them.  [30] Yahweh your God, who goes before you, He will fight for you, according to all that He did for you in Egypt before your eyes,  [31] and in the wilderness where you have seen how that Yahweh your God carried you, as a man carries His son, in all the way that you went, until you came to this place.”\n     [32] Yet in this thing you didn’t believe Yahweh your God,  [33] who went before you on the way, to seek out a place for you to pitch your tents in: in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go, and in the cloud by day.  [34] Yahweh heard the voice of your words and was angry, and swore, saying,  [35] “Surely not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good land which I swore to give to your fathers,  [36] except Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He shall see it. I will give the land that He has trodden on to Him and to His children, because He has wholly followed Yahweh.”\n     [37] Also Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, saying, “You also shall not go in there.  [38] Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, shall go in there. Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.  [39] Moreover your little ones, whom you said would be captured or killed, your children, who today have no knowledge of good or evil, shall go in there. I will give it to them, and they shall possess it.  [40] But as for you, turn, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.”\n     [41] Then you answered and said to me, “We have sinned against Yahweh. We will go up and fight, according to all that Yahweh our God commanded us.” Every man of you put on His weapons of war, and presumed to go up into the hill country.\n     [42] Yahweh said to me, “Tell them, ‘Don’t go up and don’t fight; for I am not among you, lest you be struck before your enemies.’”\n     [43] So I spoke to you, and you didn’t listen; but you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill country.  [44] The Amorites, who lived in that hill country, came out against you and chased you as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even to Hormah.  [45] You returned and wept before Yahweh, but Yahweh didn’t listen to your voice, nor turn His ear to you.  [46] So you stayed in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you remained.\n"

Turn northward.  [4] Command the people, saying, ‘You are to pass through the border of your brothers, the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. Therefore be careful.  [5] Don’t contend with them; for I will not give you any of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a possession.  [6] You shall purchase food from them for money, that you may eat. You shall also buy water from them for money, that you may drink.’”\n     [7] For Yahweh your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has known your walking through this great wilderness. These forty years, Yahweh your God has been with you. You have lacked nothing.\n     [8] So we passed by from our brothers, the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber. We turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.\n     [9] Yahweh said to me, “Don’t bother Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give you any of His land for a possession, because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.”\n     [10] (The Emim lived there before, a great and numerous people, and tall as the Anakim.  [11] These also are considered to be Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim.  [12] The Horites also lived in Seir in the past, but the children of Esau succeeded them. They destroyed them from before them, and lived in their place, as Israel did to the land of His possession, which Yahweh gave to them.)\n     [13] “Now rise up and cross over the brook Zered.” We went over the brook Zered.\n     [14] The days in which we came from Kadesh Barnea until we had come over the brook Zered were thirty-eight years, until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the middle of the camp, as Yahweh swore to them.  [15] Moreover Yahweh’s hand was against them, to destroy them from the middle of the camp, until they were consumed.  [16] So, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,  [17] Yahweh spoke to me, saying,  [18] “You are to pass over Ar, the border of Moab, today.  [19] When you come near the border of the children of Ammon, don’t bother them, nor contend with them; for I will not give you any of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession, because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession.”\n     [20] (That also is considered a land of Rephaim. Rephaim lived there in the past, but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,  [21] a great people, many, and tall, as the Anakim; but Yahweh destroyed them from before Israel, and they succeeded them, and lived in their place,  [22] as he did for the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and lived in their place even to this day.  [23] Then the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza: the Caphtorim, who came out of Caphtor, destroyed them and lived in their place.)\n     [24] “Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon. Behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.  [25] Today I will begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole sky, who shall hear the report of you, and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you.”\n     [26] I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,  [27] “Let me pass through your land. I will go along by the highway. I will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left.  [28] You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink. Just let me pass through on my feet,  [29] as the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did to me, until I pass over the Jordan into the land which Yahweh our God gives us.”  [30] But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by Him, for Yahweh your God hardened His spirit and made His heart obstinate, that He might deliver Him into your hand, as it is today.\n     [31] Yahweh said to me, “Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and His land before you. Begin to possess, that you may inherit His land.”  [32] Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz.  [33] Yahweh our God delivered Him up before us; and we struck Him, His sons, and all His people.  [34] We took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones. We left no one remaining.  [35] Only the livestock we took for plunder for ourselves, with the plunder of the cities which we had taken.  [36] From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the valley, even to Gilead, there was not a city too high for us. Yahweh our God delivered up all before us.  [37] Only to the land of the children of Ammon you didn’t come near: all the banks of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill country, and wherever Yahweh our God forbade us.\n"

[2] Yahweh said to me, “Don’t fear Him; for I have delivered Him, with all His people and His land, into your hand. You shall do to Him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.”\n     [3] So Yahweh our God also delivered into our hand Og, the king of Bashan, and all His people. We struck Him until no one was left to Him remaining.  [4] We took all his cities at that time. There was not a city which we didn’t take from them: sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.  [5] All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, in addition to a great many villages without walls.  [6] We utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones.  [7] But all the livestock, and the plunder of the cities, we took for plunder for ourselves.  [8] We took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon.  [9] (The Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir.)  [10] We took all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.  [11] (For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim. Behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron. Isn’t it in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? Nine cubits was its length, and four cubits its width, after the cubit of a man.)  [12] This land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead with its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites;  [13] and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh—all the region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The same is called the land of Rephaim.  [14] Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth Jair, to this day.)  [15] I gave Gilead to Machir.  [16] To the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the valley, and its border, even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;  [17] the Arabah also, and the Jordan and its border, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.\n     [18] I commanded you at that time, saying, “Yahweh your God has given you this land to possess it. All of you men of valor shall pass over armed before your brothers, the children of Israel.  [19] But your wives, and your little ones, and your livestock, (I know that you have much livestock), shall live in your cities which I have given you,  [20] until Yahweh gives rest to your brothers, as to you, and they also possess the land which Yahweh your God gives them beyond the Jordan. Then you shall each return to His own possession, which I have given you.”\n     [21] I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, “Your eyes have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to these two kings. So shall Yahweh do to all the kingdoms where you go over.  [22] You shall not fear them; for Yahweh your God Himself fights for you.”\n     [23] I begged Yahweh at that time, saying,  [24] “Lord Yahweh, you have begun to show your servant your greatness, and your strong hand. For what god is there in heaven or in earth that can do works like yours, and mighty acts like yours?  [25] Please let me go over and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that fine mountain, and Lebanon.”\n     [26] But Yahweh was angry with me because of you, and didn’t listen to me. Yahweh said to me, “That is enough! Speak no more to me of this matter.  [27] Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and see with your eyes; for you shall not go over this Jordan.  [28] But commission Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see.”  [29] So we stayed in the valley near Beth Peor.\n"

[2] You shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall you take away from it, that you may keep the commandments of Yahweh your God which I command you.  [3] Your eyes have seen what Yahweh did because of Baal Peor; for Yahweh your God has destroyed all the men who followed Baal Peor from among you.  [4] But you who were faithful to Yahweh your God are all alive today.  [5] Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as Yahweh my God commanded me, that you should do so in the middle of the land where you go in to possess it.  [6] Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who shall hear all these statutes and say, “Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.”  [7] For what great nation is there that has a god so near to them as Yahweh our God is whenever we call on Him?  [8] What great nation is there that has statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law which I set before you today?\n     [9] Only be careful, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things which your eyes saw, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life; but make them known to your children and your children’s children—  [10] the day that you stood before Yahweh your God in Horeb, when Yahweh said to me, “Assemble the people to me, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children.”  [11] You came near and stood under the mountain. The mountain burned with fire to the heart of the sky, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness.  [12] Yahweh spoke to you out of the middle of the fire: you heard the voice of words, but you saw no form; you only heard a voice.  [13] He declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even the ten commandments. He wrote them on two stone tablets.  [14] Yahweh commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances, that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it.  [15] Be very careful, for you saw no kind of form on the day that Yahweh spoke to you in Horeb out of the middle of the fire,  [16] lest you corrupt yourselves, and make yourself a carved image in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,  [17] the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the sky,  [18] the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth;  [19] and lest you lift up your eyes to the sky, and when you see the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the army of the sky, you are drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which Yahweh your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole sky.  [20] But Yahweh has taken you, and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be to Him a people of inheritance, as it is today.  [21] Furthermore Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over the Jordan, and that I should not go in to that good land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance;  [22] but I must die in this land. I must not go over the Jordan, but you shall go over and possess that good land.  [23] Be careful, lest you forget the covenant of Yahweh your God, which He made with you, and make yourselves a carved image in the form of anything which Yahweh your God has forbidden you.  [24] For Yahweh your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God.  [25] When you father children and children’s children, and you have been long in the land, and then corrupt yourselves, and make a carved image in the form of anything, and do that which is evil in Yahweh your God’s sight to provoke Him to anger,  [26] I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that you will soon utterly perish from off the land which you go over the Jordan to possess it. You will not prolong your days on it, but will utterly be destroyed.  [27] Yahweh will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations where Yahweh will lead you away.  [28] There you will serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.  [29] But from there you shall seek Yahweh your God, and you will find Him when you search after Him with all your heart and with all your soul.  [30] When you are in oppression, and all these things have come on you, in the latter days you shall return to Yahweh your God and listen to His voice.  [31] For Yahweh your God is a merciful God. He will not fail you nor destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers which He swore to them.  [32] For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and from the one end of the sky to the other, whether there has been anything as great as this thing is, or has been heard like it?  [33] Did a people ever hear the voice of God speaking out of the middle of the fire, as you have heard, and live?  [34] Or has God tried to go and take a nation for Himself from among another nation, by trials, by signs, by wonders, by war, by a mighty hand, by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that Yahweh your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?  [35] It was shown to you so that you might know that Yahweh is God. There is no one else besides Him.  [36] Out of heaven he made you to hear his voice, that he might instruct you. On earth he made you to see his great fire; and you heard his words out of the middle of the fire.  [37] Because he loved your fathers, therefore he chose their offspring after them, and brought you out with his presence, with his great power, out of Egypt;  [38] to drive out nations from before you greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as it is today.  [39] Know therefore today, and take it to heart, that Yahweh Himself is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath. There is no one else.  [40] You shall keep His statutes and His commandments which I command you today, that it may go well with you and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which Yahweh your God gives you for all time.\n     [41] Then Moses set apart three cities beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise,  [42] that the man slayer might flee there, who kills his neighbor unintentionally and didn’t hate him in time past, and that fleeing to one of these cities he might live:  [43] Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites.\n     [44] This is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel.  [45] These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances which Moses spoke to the children of Israel when they came out of Egypt,  [46] beyond the Jordan, in the valley opposite Beth Peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel struck when they came out of Egypt.  [47] They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise;  [48] from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, even to Mount Zion (also called Hermon),  [49] and all the Arabah beyond the Jordan eastward, even to the sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.\n"

Neither shall you desire your neighbor’s house, his field, or his male servant, or his female servant, his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor’s.”\n     [22] Yahweh spoke these words to all your assembly on the mountain out of the middle of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice. He added no more. He wrote them on two stone tablets, and gave them to me.  [23] When you heard the voice out of the middle of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, you came near to me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;  [24] and you said, “Behold, Yahweh our God has shown us His glory and His greatness, and we have heard His voice out of the middle of the fire.

They have well said all that they have spoken.  [29] Oh that there were such a heart in them that they would fear me and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them and with their children forever!\n     [30] “Go tell them, ‘Return to your tents.’  [31] But as for you, stand here by me, and I will tell you all the commandments, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which you shall teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess.”\n     [32] You shall observe to do therefore as Yahweh your God has commanded you.

[9] You shall write them on the door posts of your house and on your gates.\n     [10] It shall be, when Yahweh your God brings you into the land which He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you, great and goodly cities which you didn’t build,  [11] and houses full of all good things which you didn’t fill, and cisterns dug out which you didn’t dig, vineyards and olive trees which you didn’t plant, and you shall eat and be full;  [12] then beware lest you forget Yahweh, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.  [13] You shall fear Yahweh your God; and you shall serve Him, and shall swear by His name.  [14] You shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples who are around you,  [15] for Yahweh your God among you is a jealous God, lest the anger of Yahweh your God be kindled against you, and He destroy you from off the face of the earth.  [16] You shall not tempt Yahweh your God, as you tempted Him in Massah.  [17] You shall diligently keep the commandments of Yahweh your God, and His testimonies, and His statutes, which He has commanded you.  [18] You shall do that which is right and good in Yahweh’s sight, that it may be well with you and that you may go in and possess the good land which Yahweh swore to your fathers,  [19] to thrust out all your enemies from before you, as Yahweh has spoken.\n     [20] When your son asks you in time to come, saying, “What do the testimonies, the statutes, and the ordinances, which Yahweh our God has commanded you mean?”  [21] then you shall tell your son, “We were Pharaoh’s slaves in Egypt. Yahweh brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand;  [22] and Yahweh showed great and awesome signs and wonders on Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all His house, before our eyes;  [23] and he brought us out from there, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he swore to our fathers.  [24] Yahweh commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Yahweh our God, for our good always, that He might preserve us alive, as we are today.

You shall make no covenant with them, nor show mercy to them.  [3] You shall not make marriages with them. You shall not give your daughter to his son, nor shall you take his daughter for your son.  [4] For that would turn away your sons from following me, that they may serve other gods. So Yahweh’s anger would be kindled against you, and He would destroy you quickly.  [5] But you shall deal with them like this: you shall break down their altars, dash their pillars in pieces, cut down their Asherah poles, and burn their engraved images with fire.  [6] For you are a holy people to Yahweh your God. Yahweh your God has chosen you to be a people for His own possession, above all peoples who are on the face of the earth.  [7] Yahweh didn’t set His love on you nor choose you, because you were more in number than any people; for you were the fewest of all peoples;  [8] but because Yahweh loves you, and because He desires to keep the oath which He swore to your fathers, Yahweh has brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.  [9] Know therefore that Yahweh your God Himself is God, the faithful God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness to a thousand generations with those who love Him and keep His commandments,  [10] and repays those who hate him to their face, to destroy them. He will not be slack to him who hates him. He will repay him to his face.  [11] You shall therefore keep the commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances which I command you today, to do them.  [12] It shall happen, because you listen to these ordinances and keep and do them, that Yahweh your God will keep with you the covenant and the loving kindness which He swore to your fathers.  [13] He will love you, bless you, and multiply you. He will also bless the fruit of your body and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your new wine and your oil, the increase of your livestock and the young of your flock, in the land which he swore to your fathers to give you.  [14] You will be blessed above all peoples. There won’t be male or female barren among you, or among your livestock.  [15] Yahweh will take away from you all sickness; and He will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which you know, on you, but will lay them on all those who hate you.  [16] You shall consume all the peoples whom Yahweh your God shall deliver to you. Your eye shall not pity them. You shall not serve their gods; for that would be a snare to you.  [17] If you shall say in your heart, “These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?”  [18] you shall not be afraid of them. You shall remember well what Yahweh your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt:  [19] the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs, the wonders, the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, by which Yahweh your God brought you out. So shall Yahweh your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.  [20] Moreover Yahweh your God will send the hornet among them, until those who are left, and hide themselves, perish from before you.  [21] You shall not be scared of them; for Yahweh your God is among you, a great and awesome God.  [22] Yahweh your God will cast out those nations before you little by little. You may not consume them at once, lest the animals of the field increase on you.  [23] But Yahweh your God will deliver them up before you, and will confuse them with a great confusion, until they are destroyed.  [24] He will deliver their kings into your hand, and you shall make their name perish from under the sky. No one will be able to stand before you until you have destroyed them.  [25] You shall burn the engraved images of their gods with fire. You shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it for yourself, lest you be snared in it; for it is an abomination to Yahweh your God.  [26] You shall not bring an abomination into your house and become a devoted thing like it. You shall utterly detest it. You shall utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted thing.\n"

You are to pass over the Jordan today, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourself, cities great and fortified up to the sky,  [2] a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know, and of whom you have heard say, “Who can stand before the sons of Anak?”  [3] Know therefore today that Yahweh your God is He who goes over before you as a devouring fire. He will destroy them and He will bring them down before you. So you shall drive them out and make them perish quickly, as Yahweh has spoken to you.\n     [4] Don’t say in your heart, after Yahweh your God has thrust them out from before you, “For my righteousness Yahweh has brought me in to possess this land;” because Yahweh drives them out before you because of the wickedness of these nations.  [5] Not for your righteousness or for the uprightness of your heart do you go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations Yahweh your God does drive them out from before you, and that He may establish the word which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.  [6] Know therefore that Yahweh your God doesn’t give you this good land to possess for your righteousness, for you are a stiff-necked people.  [7] Remember, and don’t forget, how you provoked Yahweh your God to wrath in the wilderness. From the day that you left the land of Egypt until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against Yahweh.  [8] Also in Horeb you provoked Yahweh to wrath, and Yahweh was angry with you to destroy you.  [9] When I had gone up onto the mountain to receive the stone tablets, even the tablets of the covenant which Yahweh made with you, then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water.  [10] Yahweh delivered to me the two stone tablets written with God’s finger. On them were all the words which Yahweh spoke with you on the mountain out of the middle of the fire in the day of the assembly.\n     [11] It came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights that Yahweh gave me the two stone tablets, even the tablets of the covenant.  [12] Yahweh said to me, “Arise, get down quickly from here; for your people whom you have brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves. They have quickly turned away from the way which I commanded them. They have made a molten image for themselves!”\n     [13] Furthermore Yahweh spoke to me, saying, “I have seen these people, and behold, they are a stiff-necked people.  [14] Leave me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under the sky; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.”\n     [15] So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire. The two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands.  [16] I looked, and behold, you had sinned against Yahweh your God. You had made yourselves a molded calf. You had quickly turned away from the way which Yahweh had commanded you.  [17] I took hold of the two tablets, and threw them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes.  [18] I fell down before Yahweh, as at the first, forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all your sin which you sinned, in doing that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, to provoke Him to anger.  [19] For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which Yahweh was angry against you to destroy you. But Yahweh listened to me that time also.  [20] Yahweh was angry enough with Aaron to destroy Him. I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.  [21] I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burned it with fire, and crushed it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust. I threw its dust into the brook that descended out of the mountain.  [22] At Taberah, at Massah, and at Kibroth Hattaavah you provoked Yahweh to wrath.  [23] When Yahweh sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, “Go up and possess the land which I have given you,” you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God, and you didn’t believe Him or listen to His voice.  [24] You have been rebellious against Yahweh from the day that I knew you.  [25] So I fell down before Yahweh the forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because Yahweh had said He would destroy you.  [26] I prayed to Yahweh, and said, “Lord Yahweh, don’t destroy your people and your inheritance that you have redeemed through your greatness, that you have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.  [27] Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Don’t look at the stubbornness of this people, nor at their wickedness, nor at their sin,  [28] lest the land you brought us out from say, ‘Because Yahweh was not able to bring them into the land which He promised to them, and because He hated them, He has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.’  [29] Yet they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm.”\n"

The right of the firstborn is his.\n     [18] If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and though they chasten him, will not listen to them,  [19] then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city and to the gate of his place.

He is a glutton and a drunkard.”  [21] All the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones. So you shall remove the evil from among you.

You will only be oppressed and crushed always,  [34] so that the sights that you see with your eyes will drive you mad.  [35] Yahweh will strike you in the knees and in the legs with a sore boil, of which you cannot be healed, from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head.  [36] Yahweh will bring you, and your king whom you will set over yourselves, to a nation that you have not known, you nor your fathers. There you will serve other gods of wood and stone.  [37] You will become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword among all the peoples where Yahweh will lead you away.  [38] You will carry much seed out into the field, and will gather little in, for the locust will consume it.  [39] You will plant vineyards and dress them, but you will neither drink of the wine, nor harvest, because worms will eat them.  [40] You will have olive trees throughout all your borders, but you won’t anoint yourself with the oil, for your olives will drop off.  [41] You will father sons and daughters, but they will not be yours, for they will go into captivity.  [42] Locusts will consume all of your trees and the fruit of your ground.  [43] The foreigner who is among you will mount up above you higher and higher, and you will come down lower and lower.  [44] He will lend to you, and you won’t lend to him. He will be the head, and you will be the tail.\n     [45] All these curses will come on you, and will pursue you and overtake you, until you are destroyed, because you didn’t listen to Yahweh your God’s voice, to keep His commandments and His statutes which He commanded you.  [46] They will be for a sign and for a wonder to you and to your offspring forever.  [47] Because you didn’t serve Yahweh your God with joyfulness and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things;  [48] therefore you will serve your enemies whom Yahweh sends against you, in hunger, in thirst, in nakedness, and in lack of all things. He will put an iron yoke on your neck until He has destroyed you.  [49] Yahweh will bring a nation against you from far away, from the end of the earth, as the eagle flies: a nation whose language you will not understand,  [50] a nation of fierce facial expressions, that doesn’t respect the elderly, nor show favor to the young.  [51] They will eat the fruit of your livestock and the fruit of your ground, until you are destroyed. They also won’t leave you grain, new wine, oil, the increase of your livestock, or the young of your flock, until they have caused you to perish.  [52] They will besiege you in all your gates until your high and fortified walls in which you trusted come down throughout all your land. They will besiege you in all your gates throughout all your land which Yahweh your God has given you.  [53] You will eat the fruit of your own body, the flesh of your sons and of your daughters, whom Yahweh your God has given you, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemies will distress you.  [54] The man who is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye will be evil toward his brother, toward the wife whom he loves, and toward the remnant of his children whom he has remaining,  [55] so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he will eat, because he has nothing left to him, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy will distress you in all your gates.  [56] The tender and delicate woman among you, who would not venture to set the sole of her foot on the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye will be evil toward the husband that she loves, toward her son, toward her daughter,  [57] toward her young one who comes out from between her feet, and toward her children whom she bears; for she will eat them secretly for lack of all things in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy will distress you in your gates.  [58] If you will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and fearful name, YAHWEH your God,  [59] then Yahweh will make your plagues and the plagues of your offspring fearful, even great plagues, and of long duration, and severe sicknesses, and of long duration.  [60] He will bring on you again all the diseases of Egypt, which you were afraid of; and they will cling to you.  [61] Also every sickness and every plague which is not written in the book of this law, Yahweh will bring them on you until you are destroyed.  [62] You will be left few in number, even though you were as the stars of the sky for multitude, because you didn’t listen to Yahweh your God’s voice.  [63] It will happen that as Yahweh rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you, so Yahweh will rejoice over you to cause you to perish and to destroy you. You will be plucked from the land that you are going in to possess.  [64] Yahweh will scatter you among all peoples, from one end of the earth to the other end of the earth. There you will serve other gods which you have not known, you nor your fathers, even wood and stone.  [65] Among these nations you will find no ease, and there will be no rest for the sole of your foot; but Yahweh will give you there a trembling heart, failing of eyes, and pining of soul.  [66] Your life will hang in doubt before you. You will be afraid night and day, and will have no assurance of your life.  [67] In the morning you will say, “I wish it were evening!” and at evening you will say, “I wish it were morning!” for the fear of your heart which you will fear, and for the sights which your eyes will see.  [68] Yahweh will bring you into Egypt again with ships, by the way of which I told to you that you would never see it again. There you will offer yourselves to your enemies for male and female slaves, and nobody will buy you.\n"

[2] Moses called to all Israel, and said to them:\n    Your eyes have seen all that Yahweh did in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all His servants, and to all His land;  [3] the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders.  [4] But Yahweh has not given you a heart to know, eyes to see, and ears to hear, to this day.  [5] I have led you forty years in the wilderness. Your clothes have not grown old on you, and your sandals have not grown old on your feet.  [6] You have not eaten bread, neither have you drunk wine or strong drink, that you may know that I am Yahweh your God.  [7] When you came to this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon and Og the king of Bashan came out against us to battle, and we struck them.  [8] We took their land, and gave it for an inheritance to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of the Manassites.  [9] Therefore keep the words of this covenant and do them, that you may prosper in all that you do.  [10] All of you stand today in the presence of Yahweh your God: your heads, your tribes, your elders, and your officers, even all the men of Israel,  [11] your little ones, your wives, and the foreigners who are in the middle of your camps, from the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water,  [12] that you may enter into the covenant of Yahweh your God, and into His oath, which Yahweh your God makes with you today,  [13] that He may establish you today as His people, and that He may be your God, as He spoke to you and as He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.  [14] Neither do I make this covenant and this oath with you only,  [15] but with those who stand here with us today before Yahweh our God, and also with those who are not here with us today  [16] (for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the middle of the nations through which you passed;  [17] and you have seen their abominations and their idols of wood, stone, silver, and gold, which were among them);  [18] lest there should be among you man, woman, family, or tribe whose heart turns away today from Yahweh our God, to go to serve the gods of those nations; lest there should be among you a root that produces bitter poison;  [19] and it happen, when he hears the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, “I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart,” to destroy the moist with the dry.  [20] Yahweh will not pardon Him, but then Yahweh’s anger and His jealousy will smoke against that man, and all the curse that is written in this book will fall on Him, and Yahweh will blot out His name from under the sky.  [21] Yahweh will set Him apart for evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant written in this book of the law.\n     [22] The generation to come—your children who will rise up after you, and the foreigner who will come from a far land—will say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses with which Yahweh has made it sick,  [23] that all of its land is sulfur, salt, and burning, that it is not sown, doesn’t produce, nor does any grass grow in it, like the overthrow of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, which Yahweh overthrew in His anger, and in His wrath.  [24] Even all the nations will say, “Why has Yahweh done this to this land? What does the heat of this great anger mean?”\n     [25] Then men will say, “Because they abandoned the covenant of Yahweh, the God of their fathers, which He made with them when He brought them out of the land of Egypt,  [26] and went and served other gods and worshiped them, gods that they didn’t know and that he had not given to them.  [27] Therefore Yahweh’s anger burned against this land, to bring on it all the curses that are written in this book.  [28] Yahweh rooted them out of their land in anger, in wrath, and in great indignation, and thrust them into another land, as it is today.”\n     [29] The secret things belong to Yahweh our God; but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law.\n"

[12] It is not in heaven, that you should say, “Who will go up for us to heaven, bring it to us, and proclaim it to us, that we may do it?”  [13] Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, “Who will go over the sea for us, bring it to us, and proclaim it to us, that we may do it?”  [14] But the word is very near to you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do it.  [15] Behold, I have set before you today life and prosperity, and death and evil.  [16] For I command you today to love Yahweh your God, to walk in His ways and to keep His commandments, His statutes, and His ordinances, that you may live and multiply, and that Yahweh your God may bless you in the land where you go in to possess it.  [17] But if your heart turns away, and you will not hear, but are drawn away and worship other gods, and serve them,  [18] I declare to you today that you will surely perish. You will not prolong your days in the land where you pass over the Jordan to go in to possess it.  [19] I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse. Therefore choose life, that you may live, you and your descendants,  [20] to love Yahweh your God, to obey His voice, and to cling to Him; for He is your life, and the length of your days, that you may dwell in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.\n"

Yahweh has said to me, ‘You shall not go over this Jordan.’  [3] Yahweh your God Himself will go over before you. He will destroy these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua will go over before you, as Yahweh has spoken.  [4] Yahweh will do to them as He did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land, when He destroyed them.  [5] Yahweh will deliver them up before you, and you shall do to them according to all the commandment which I have commanded you.  [6] Be strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid or scared of them, for Yahweh your God Himself is who goes with you. He will not fail you nor forsake you.”\n     [7] Moses called to Joshua, and said to Him in the sight of all Israel, “Be strong and courageous, for you shall go with this people into the land which Yahweh has sworn to their fathers to give them; and you shall cause them to inherit it.  [8] Yahweh Himself is who goes before you. He will be with you. He will not fail you nor forsake you. Don’t be afraid. Don’t be discouraged.”\n     [9] Moses wrote this law and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, and to all the elders of Israel.  [10] Moses commanded them, saying, “At the end of every seven years, in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of booths,  [11] when all Israel has come to appear before Yahweh your God in the place which He will choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing.  [12] Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and the foreigners who are within your gates, that they may hear, learn, fear Yahweh your God, and observe to do all the words of this law,  [13] and that their children, who have not known, may hear and learn to fear Yahweh your God, as long as you live in the land where you go over the Jordan to possess it.”\n     [14] Yahweh said to Moses, “Behold, your days approach that you must die. Call Joshua, and present yourselves in the Tent of Meeting, that I may commission Him.”\n    Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the Tent of Meeting.\n     [15] Yahweh appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood over the Tent’s door.  [16] Yahweh said to Moses, “Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers. This people will rise up and play the prostitute after the strange gods of the land where they go to be among them, and will forsake me and break my covenant which I have made with them.  [17] Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come on them; so that they will say in that day, ‘Haven’t these evils come on us because our God is not among us?’  [18] I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they have done, in that they have turned to other gods.\n     [19] “Now therefore write this song for yourselves, and teach it to the children of Israel. Put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.  [20] For when I have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and they have eaten and filled themselves, and grown fat, then they will turn to other gods, and serve them, and despise me, and break my covenant.  [21] It will happen, when many evils and troubles have come on them, that this song will testify before them as a witness; for it will not be forgotten out of the mouths of their descendants; for I know their ways and what they are doing today, before I have brought them into the land which I promised them.”\n     [22] So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the children of Israel.\n     [23] He commissioned Joshua the son of Nun, and said, “Be strong and courageous; for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them. I will be with you.”\n     [24] When Moses had finished writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,  [25] Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, saying,  [26] “Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of Yahweh your God’s covenant, that it may be there for a witness against you.  [27] For I know your rebellion and your stiff neck. Behold, while I am yet alive with you today, you have been rebellious against Yahweh. How much more after my death?  [28] Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them.  [29] For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn away from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will happen to you in the latter days, because you will do that which is evil in Yahweh’s sight, to provoke Him to anger through the work of your hands.”\n     [30] Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished.\n"

sacrificed to demons, not God,\n    to gods that they didn’t know,\n    to new gods that came up recently,\n    which your fathers didn’t dread.\n   [18] Of the Rock who became your father, you are unmindful,\n    and have forgotten God who gave you birth.\n   [19] Yahweh saw and abhorred,\n    because of the provocation of His sons and His daughters.\n   [20] He said, “I will hide my face from them.\n    I will see what their end will be;\n  for they are a very perverse generation,\n    children in whom is no faithfulness.\n   [21] They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not

adversaries should judge wrongly,\n    lest they should say, ‘Our hand is exalted;\n    Yahweh has not done all this.’”\n    \n   [28] For they are a nation void of counsel.\n    There is no

that there is no one remaining, shut up or left at large.\n   [37] He will say, “Where are their gods,\n    the rock in which they took refuge,\n   [38] which ate the fat of their sacrifices,\n    and drank the wine of their drink offering?\n  Let them rise up and help you!\n    Let them be your protection.\n    \n   [39] “See now that I myself am He.\n    There is no god with me.\n  I kill and I

ears of the people, he and Joshua the son of Nun.  [45] Moses finished reciting all these words to all Israel.  [46] He said to them, “Set your heart to all the words which I testify to you today, which you shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.  [47] For it is no vain thing for you, because it is your life, and through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land, where you go over the Jordan to possess it.”\n     [48] Yahweh spoke to Moses that same day, saying,  [49] “Go up into this mountain of Abarim, to Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is across from Jericho; and see the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel for a possession.  [50] Die on the mountain where you go up, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor, and was gathered to his people;  [51] because you trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you didn’t uphold my holiness among the children of Israel.

Now therefore arise, go across this Jordan, you and all these people, to the land which I am giving to them, even to the children of Israel.  [3] I have given you every place that the sole of your foot will tread on, as I told Moses.  [4] From the wilderness and this Lebanon even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border.  [5] No man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not fail you nor forsake you.\n     [6] “Be strong and courageous; for you shall cause this people to inherit the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.  [7] Only be strong and very courageous. Be careful to observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded you. Don’t turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may have good success wherever you go.  [8] This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it; for then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall have good success.  [9] Haven’t I commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid. Don’t be dismayed, for Yahweh your God is with you wherever you go.”\n     [10] Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,  [11] “Pass through the middle of the camp, and command the people, saying, ‘Prepare food; for within three days you are to pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which Yahweh your God gives you to possess.’”\n     [12] Joshua spoke to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, saying,  [13] “Remember the word which Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you, saying, ‘Yahweh your God gives you rest, and will give you this land.  [14] Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock shall live in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan; but you shall pass over before your brothers armed, all the mighty men of valor, and shall help them  [15] until Yahweh has given your brothers rest, as He has given you, and they have also possessed the land which Yahweh your God gives them. Then you shall return to the land of your possession and possess it, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise.’”\n     [16] They answered Joshua, saying, “All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.  [17] Just as we listened to Moses in all things, so will we listen to you. Only may Yahweh your God be with you, as He was with Moses.

Then she said, “Yes, the men came to me, but I didn’t know where they came from.  [5] About the time of the shutting of the gate, when it was dark, the men went out. Where the men went, I don’t know. Pursue them quickly. You may catch up with them.”  [6] But she had brought them up to the roof, and hidden them under the stalks of flax which she had laid in order on the roof.  [7] The men pursued them along the way to the fords of the Jordan River. As soon as those who pursued them had gone out, they shut the gate.  [8] Before they had lain down, she came up to them on the roof.  [9] She said to the men, “I know that Yahweh has given you the land, and that the fear of you has fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you.  [10] For we have heard how Yahweh dried up the water of the Red Sea before you, when you came out of Egypt; and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, whom you utterly destroyed.  [11] As soon as we had heard it, our hearts melted, and there wasn’t any more spirit in any man, because of you: for Yahweh your God, He is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath.  [12] Now therefore, please swear to me by Yahweh, since I have dealt kindly with you, that you also will deal kindly with my father’s house, and give me a true sign;  [13] and that you will save alive my father, my mother, my brothers, and my sisters, and all that they have, and will deliver our lives from death.”\n     [14] The men said to her, “Our life for yours, if you don’t talk about this business of ours; and it shall be, when Yahweh gives us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you.”\n     [15] Then she let them down by a cord through the window; for her house was on the side of the wall, and she lived on the wall.  [16] She said to them, “Go to the mountain, lest the pursuers find you. Hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers have returned. Afterward, you may go your way.”\n     [17] The men said to her, “We will be guiltless of this your oath which you’ve made us to swear.  [18] Behold, when we come into the land, tie this line of scarlet thread in the window which you used to let us down. Gather to yourself into the house your father, your mother, your brothers, and all your father’s household.  [19] It shall be that whoever goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood will be on his head, and we will be guiltless. Whoever is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand is on him.  [20] But if you talk about this business of ours, then we shall be guiltless of your oath which you’ve made us to swear.”\n     [21] She said, “Let it be as you have said.” She sent them away, and they departed. Then she tied the scarlet line in the window.\n     [22] They went and came to the mountain, and stayed there three days, until the pursuers had returned. The pursuers sought them all along the way, but didn’t find them.  [23] Then the two men returned, descended from the mountain, crossed the river, and came to Joshua the son of Nun. They told him all that had happened to them.  [24] They said to Joshua, “Truly Yahweh has delivered all the land into our hands. Moreover, all the inhabitants of the land melt away before us.”\n"

[4] Yet there shall be a space between you and it of about two thousand cubits by measure—don’t come closer to it—that you may know the way by which you must go; for you have not passed this way before.”\n     [5] Joshua said to the people, “Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow Yahweh will do wonders among you.”\n     [6] Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and cross over before the people.” They took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.\n     [7] Yahweh said to Joshua, “Today I will begin to magnify you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.  [8] You shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, ‘When you come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.’”\n     [9] Joshua said to the children of Israel, “Come here, and hear the words of Yahweh your God.”  [10] Joshua said, “By this you shall know that the living God is among you, and that He will without fail drive the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Hivite, the Perizzite, the Girgashite, the Amorite, and the Jebusite out from before you.  [11] Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passes over before you into the Jordan.  [12] Now therefore take twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, for every tribe a man.  [13] It shall be that when the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of Yahweh, the Lord of all the earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan will be cut off. The waters that come down from above shall stand in one heap.”\n     [14] When the people moved from their tents to pass over the Jordan, the priests who bore the ark of the covenant being before the people,  [15] and when those who bore the ark had come to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who bore the ark had dipped in the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks all the time of harvest),  [16] the waters which came down from above stood, and rose up in one heap a great way off, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan; and those that went down toward the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off. Then the people passed over near Jericho.  [17] The priests who bore the ark of Yahweh’s covenant stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan; and all Israel crossed over on dry ground, until all the nation had passed completely over the Jordan.\n"

[5] Joshua said to them, “Cross before the ark of Yahweh your God into the middle of the Jordan, and each of you pick up a stone and put it on your shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel;  [6] that this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask in the future, saying, ‘What do you mean by these stones?’  [7] then you shall tell them, ‘Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of Yahweh’s covenant. When it crossed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones shall be for a memorial to the children of Israel forever.’”\n     [8] The children of Israel did as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the middle of the Jordan, as Yahweh spoke to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel. They carried them over with them to the place where they camped, and laid them down there.  [9] Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood; and they are there to this day.  [10] For the priests who bore the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan until everything was finished that Yahweh commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua; and the people hurried and passed over.  [11] When all the people had completely crossed over, Yahweh’s ark crossed over with the priests in the presence of the people.\n     [12] The children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spoke to them.  [13] About forty thousand men, ready and armed for war, passed over before Yahweh to battle, to the plains of Jericho.

[19] The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east border of Jericho.\n     [20] Joshua set up those twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, in Gilgal.  [21] He spoke to the children of Israel, saying, “When your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, ‘What do these stones mean?’  [22] Then you shall let your children know, saying, ‘Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.

[2] At that time, Yahweh said to Joshua, “Make flint knives, and circumcise again the sons of Israel the second time.”  [3] Joshua made himself flint knives, and circumcised the sons of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.  [4] This is the reason Joshua circumcised them: all the people who came out of Egypt, who were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness along the way, after they came out of Egypt.  [5] For all the people who came out were circumcised; but all the people who were born in the wilderness along the way as they came out of Egypt had not been circumcised.  [6] For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness until all the nation, even the men of war who came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they didn’t listen to Yahweh’s voice. Yahweh swore to them that He wouldn’t let them see the land which Yahweh swore to their fathers that He would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.  [7] Their children, whom he raised up in their place, were circumcised by Joshua, for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them on the way.  [8] When they were done circumcising the whole nation, they stayed in their places in the camp until they were healed.\n     [9] Yahweh said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.” Therefore the name of that place was called Gilgal to this day.  [10] The children of Israel encamped in Gilgal. They kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.  [11] They ate unleavened cakes and parched grain of the produce of the land on the next day after the Passover, in the same day.  [12] The manna ceased on the next day, after they had eaten of the produce of the land. The children of Israel didn’t have manna any more, but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.\n     [13] When Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood in front of him with his sword drawn in his hand. Joshua went to him and said to him, “Are you for us, or for our enemies?”\n     [14] He said, “No; but I have come now as commander of Yahweh’s army.”\n    Joshua fell on His face to the earth, and worshiped, and asked Him, “What does my lord say to His servant?”\n     [15] The prince of Yahweh’s army said to Joshua, “Take off your sandals, for the place on which you stand is holy.” Joshua did so.\n"

[3] All of your men of war shall march around the city, going around the city once. You shall do this six days.  [4] Seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark. On the seventh day, you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.  [5] It shall be that when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; then the city wall will fall down flat, and the people shall go up, every man straight in front of him.”\n     [6] Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before Yahweh’s ark.”\n     [7] They said to the people, “Advance! March around the city, and let the armed men pass on before Yahweh’s ark.”\n     [8] It was so, that when Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before Yahweh advanced and blew the trumpets, and the ark of Yahweh’s covenant followed them.  [9] The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the ark went after them. The trumpets sounded as they went.\n     [10] Joshua commanded the people, saying, “You shall not shout nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I tell you to shout. Then you shall shout.”  [11] So He caused Yahweh’s ark to go around the city, circling it once. Then they came into the camp, and stayed in the camp.  [12] Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up Yahweh’s ark.  [13] The seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns in front of Yahweh’s ark went on continually, and blew the trumpets. The armed men went in front of them. The rear guard came after Yahweh’s ark. The trumpets sounded as they went.  [14] The second day they marched around the city once, and returned into the camp. They did this six days.\n     [15] On the seventh day, they rose early at the dawning of the day, and marched around the city in the same way seven times. On this day only they marched around the city seven times.  [16] At the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, “Shout, for Yahweh has given you the city!  [17] The city shall be devoted, even it and all that is in it, to Yahweh. Only Rahab the prostitute shall live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.  [18] But as for you, only keep yourselves from what is devoted to destruction, lest when you have devoted it, you take of the devoted thing; so you would make the camp of Israel accursed and trouble it.  [19] But all the silver, gold, and vessels of bronze and iron are holy to Yahweh. They shall come into Yahweh’s treasury.”\n     [20] So the people shouted and the priests blew the trumpets. When the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight in front of him, and they took the city.  [21] They utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, sheep, and donkey, with the edge of the sword.  [22] Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, “Go into the prostitute’s house, and bring the woman and all that she has out from there, as you swore to her.”  [23] The young men who were spies went in, and brought out Rahab with her father, her mother, her brothers, and all that she had. They also brought out all of her relatives, and they set them outside of the camp of Israel.  [24] They burned the city with fire, and all that was in it. Only they put the silver, the gold, and the vessels of bronze and of iron into the treasury of Yahweh’s house.  [25] But Rahab the prostitute, her father’s household, and all that she had, Joshua saved alive. She lives in the middle of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.\n     [26] Joshua commanded them with an oath at that time, saying, “Cursed is the man before Yahweh who rises up and builds this city Jericho. With the loss of His firstborn He will lay its foundation, and with the loss of His youngest son He will set up its gates.”  [27] So Yahweh was with Joshua; and His fame was in all the land.\n"

[2] Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth Aven, on the east side of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, “Go up and spy out the land.”\n    The men went up and spied out Ai.  [3] They returned to Joshua, and said to him, “Don’t let all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and strike Ai. Don’t make all the people to toil there, for there are only a few of them.”  [4] So about three thousand men of the people went up there, and they fled before the men of Ai.  [5] The men of Ai struck about thirty-six men of them. They chased them from before the gate even to Shebarim, and struck them at the descent. The hearts of the people melted, and became like water.  [6] Joshua tore His clothes, and fell to the earth on His face before Yahweh’s ark until the evening, He and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads.  [7] Joshua said, “Alas, Lord Yahweh, why have you brought this people over the Jordan at all, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? I wish that we had been content and lived beyond the Jordan!  [8] Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after Israel has turned their backs before their enemies?  [9] For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will surround us, and cut off our name from the earth. What will you do for your great name?”\n     [10] Yahweh said to Joshua, “Get up! Why have you fallen on your face like that?  [11] Israel has sinned. Yes, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them. Yes, they have even taken some of the devoted things, and have also stolen, and also deceived. They have even put it among their own stuff.  [12] Therefore the children of Israel can’t stand before their enemies. They turn their backs before their enemies, because they have become devoted for destruction. I will not be with you any more, unless you destroy the devoted things from among you.  [13] Get up! Sanctify the people, and say, ‘Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, for Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, “There is a devoted thing among you, Israel. You cannot stand before your enemies until you take away the devoted thing from among you.”  [14] In the morning therefore you shall be brought near by your tribes. It shall be that the tribe which Yahweh selects shall come near by families. The family which Yahweh selects shall come near by households. The household which Yahweh selects shall come near man by man.  [15] It shall be, that He who is taken with the devoted thing shall be burned with fire, He and all that He has, because He has transgressed Yahweh’s covenant, and because He has done a disgraceful thing in Israel.’”\n     [16] So Joshua rose up early in the morning and brought Israel near by their tribes. The tribe of Judah was selected.  [17] He brought near the family of Judah, and he selected the family of the Zerahites. He brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man, and Zabdi was selected.  [18] He brought near his household man by man, and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was selected.  [19] Joshua said to Achan, “My son, please give glory to Yahweh, the God of Israel, and make confession to Him. Tell me now what you have done! Don’t hide it from me!”\n     [20] Achan answered Joshua, and said, “I have truly sinned against Yahweh, the God of Israel, and this is what I have done.  [21] When I saw among the plunder a beautiful Babylonian robe, two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels, then I coveted them and took them. Behold, they are hidden in the ground in the middle of my tent, with the silver under it.”\n     [22] So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent. Behold, it was hidden in his tent, with the silver under it.  [23] They took them from the middle of the tent, and brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel. They laid them down before Yahweh.  [24] Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the wedge of gold, his sons, his daughters, his cattle, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and all that he had; and they brought them up to the valley of Achor.  [25] Joshua said, “Why have you troubled us? Yahweh will trouble you today.” All Israel stoned Him with stones, and they burned them with fire and stoned them with stones.  [26] They raised over Him a great heap of stones that remains to this day. Yahweh turned from the fierceness of His anger. Therefore the name of that place was called “The valley of Achor” to this day.\n"

Behold, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, with His people, His city, and His land.  [2] You shall do to Ai and her king as you did to Jericho and her king, except you shall take its goods and its livestock for yourselves. Set an ambush for the city behind it.”\n     [3] So Joshua arose, with all the warriors, to go up to Ai. Joshua chose thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valor, and sent them out by night.  [4] He commanded them, saying, “Behold, you shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city. Don’t go very far from the city, but all of you be ready.  [5] I and all the people who are with me will approach the city. It shall happen, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them.  [6] They will come out after us until we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say, ‘They flee before us, like the first time.’ So we will flee before them,  [7] and you shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city; for Yahweh your God will deliver it into your hand.  [8] It shall be, when you have seized the city, that you shall set the city on fire. You shall do this according to Yahweh’s word. Behold, I have commanded you.”\n     [9] Joshua sent them out; and they went to set up the ambush, and stayed between Bethel and Ai on the west side of Ai; but Joshua stayed among the people that night.  [10] Joshua rose up early in the morning, mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.  [11] All the people, even the men of war who were with him, went up and came near, and came before the city and encamped on the north side of Ai. Now there was a valley between him and Ai.  [12] He took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.  [13] So they set the people, even all the army who was on the north of the city, and their ambush on the west of the city; and Joshua went that night into the middle of the valley.  [14] When the king of Ai saw it, they hurried and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed, before the Arabah; but he didn’t know that there was an ambush against him behind the city.  [15] Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.  [16] All the people who were in the city were called together to pursue after them. They pursued Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.  [17] There was not a man left in Ai or Bethel who didn’t go out after Israel. They left the city open, and pursued Israel.\n     [18] Yahweh said to Joshua, “Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand.”\n    Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in His hand toward the city.  [19] The ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand and entered into the city and took it. They hurried and set the city on fire.  [20] When the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way. The people who fled to the wilderness turned back on the pursuers.  [21] When Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned back and killed the men of Ai.  [22] The others came out of the city against them, so they were in the middle of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side. They struck them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.  [23] They captured the king of Ai alive, and brought him to Joshua.\n     [24] When Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they pursued them, and they had all fallen by the edge of the sword until they were consumed, all Israel returned to Ai and struck it with the edge of the sword.  [25] All that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the people of Ai.  [26] For Joshua didn’t draw back his hand, with which he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.  [27] Israel took for themselves only the livestock and the goods of that city, according to Yahweh’s word which He commanded Joshua.  [28] So Joshua burned Ai and made it a heap forever, even a desolation, to this day.  [29] He hanged the king of Ai on a tree until the evening. At sundown, Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree and threw it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised a great heap of stones on it that remains to this day.\n     [30] Then Joshua built an altar to Yahweh, the God of Israel, on Mount Ebal,  [31] as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses: an altar of uncut stones, on which no one had lifted up any iron. They offered burnt offerings on it to Yahweh and sacrificed peace offerings.  [32] He wrote there on the stones a copy of Moses’ law, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.  [33] All Israel, with their elders, officers, and judges, stood on both sides of the ark before the Levitical priests, who carried the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, the foreigner as well as the native; half of them in front of Mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of Yahweh had commanded at the first, that they should bless the people of Israel.  [34] Afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law.  [35] There was not a word of all that Moses commanded which Joshua didn’t read before all the assembly of Israel, with the women, the little ones, and the foreigners who were among them.\n"

[3] But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,  [4] they also resorted to a ruse, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks on their donkeys, and old, torn-up and bound up wine skins,  [5] and old and patched sandals on their feet, and wore old garments. All the bread of their food supply was dry and moldy.  [6] They went to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal, and said to him and to the men of Israel, “We have come from a far country. Now therefore make a covenant with us.”\n     [7] The men of Israel said to the Hivites, “What if you live among us? How could we make a covenant with you?”\n     [8] They said to Joshua, “We are your servants.”\n    Joshua said to them, “Who are you? Where do you come from?”\n     [9] They said to Him, “Your servants have come from a very far country because of the name of Yahweh your God; for we have heard of His fame, all that He did in Egypt,  [10] and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.  [11] Our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, ‘Take supplies in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them. Tell them, “We are your servants. Now make a covenant with us.”’  [12] This our bread we took hot for our supplies out of our houses on the day we went out to go to you; but now, behold, it is dry, and has become moldy.  [13] These wine skins, which we filled, were new; and behold, they are torn. These our garments and our sandals have become old because of the very long journey.”\n     [14] The men sampled their provisions, and didn’t ask counsel from Yahweh’s mouth.  [15] Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live. The princes of the congregation swore to them.  [16] At the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they lived among them.  [17] The children of Israel traveled and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim.  [18] The children of Israel didn’t strike them, because the princes of the congregation had sworn to them by Yahweh, the God of Israel. All the congregation murmured against the princes.  [19] But all the princes said to all the congregation, “We have sworn to them by Yahweh, the God of Israel. Now therefore we may not touch them.  [20] We will do this to them, and let them live; lest wrath be on us, because of the oath which we swore to them.”  [21] The princes said to them, “Let them live.” So they became wood cutters and drawers of water for all the congregation, as the princes had spoken to them.\n     [22] Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, “Why have you deceived us, saying, ‘We are very far from you,’ when you live among us?  [23] Now therefore you are cursed, and some of you will never fail to be slaves, both wood cutters and drawers of water for the house of my God.”\n     [24] They answered Joshua, and said, “Because your servants were certainly told how Yahweh your God commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you. Therefore we were very afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing.  [25] Now, behold, we are in your hand. Do to us as it seems good and right to you to do.”\n     [26] He did so to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, so that they didn’t kill them.  [27] That day Joshua made them wood cutters and drawers of water for the congregation and for Yahweh’s altar to this day, in the place which He should choose.\n"

          "content": "     [1] Now when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them,  [2] they were very afraid, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty.  [3] Therefore Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish, and Debir king of Eglon, saying,  [4] “Come up to me and help me. Let’s strike Gibeon; for they have made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.”  [5] Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together and went up, they and all their armies, and encamped against Gibeon, and made war against it.  [6] The men of Gibeon sent to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal, saying, “Don’t abandon your servants! Come up to us quickly and save us! Help us; for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill country have gathered together against us.”\n     [7] So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and the whole army with him, including all the mighty men of valor.  [8] Yahweh said to Joshua, “Don’t fear them, for I have delivered them into your hands. Not a man of them will stand before you.”\n     [9] Joshua therefore came to them suddenly. He marched from Gilgal all night.  [10] Yahweh confused them before Israel. He killed them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth Horon, and struck them to Azekah and to Makkedah.  [11] As they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth Horon, Yahweh hurled down great stones from the sky on them to Azekah, and they died. There were more who died from the hailstones than those whom the children of Israel killed with the sword.\n     [12] Then Joshua spoke to Yahweh in the day when Yahweh delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel. He said in the sight of Israel, “Sun, stand still on Gibeon! You, moon, stop in the valley of Aijalon!”\n     [13] The sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies. Isn’t this written in the book of Jashar? The sun stayed in the middle of the sky, and didn’t hurry to go down about a whole day.  [14] There was no day like that before it or after it, that Yahweh listened to the voice of a man; for Yahweh fought for Israel.\n     [15] Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.  [16] These five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.  [17] Joshua was told, saying, “The five kings have been found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah.”\n     [18] Joshua said, “Roll large stones to cover the cave’s entrance, and set men by it to guard them;  [19] but don’t stay there. Pursue your enemies, and attack them from the rear. Don’t allow them to enter into their cities; for Yahweh your God has delivered them into your hand.”\n     [20] When Joshua and the children of Israel had finished killing them with a very great slaughter until they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities,  [21] all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace. None moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.  [22] Then Joshua said, “Open the cave entrance, and bring those five kings out of the cave to me.”\n     [23] They did so, and brought those five kings out of the cave to him: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.  [24] When they brought those kings out to Joshua, Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the men of war who went with him, “Come near. Put your feet on the necks of these kings.”\n    They came near, and put their feet on their necks.\n     [25] Joshua said to them, “Don’t be afraid, nor be dismayed. Be strong and courageous, for Yahweh will do this to all your enemies against whom you fight.”\n     [26] Afterward Joshua struck them, put them to death, and hanged them on five trees. They were hanging on the trees until the evening.  [27] At the time of the going down of the sun, Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and threw them into the cave in which they had hidden themselves, and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, which remain to this very day.\n     [28] Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, with its king. He utterly destroyed it and all the souls who were in it. He left no one remaining. He did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.\n     [29] Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah.  [30] Yahweh delivered it also, with its king, into the hand of Israel. He struck it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls who were in it. He left no one remaining in it. He did to its king as He had done to the king of Jericho.\n     [31] Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it.  [32] Yahweh delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel. He took it on the second day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, with all the souls who were in it, according to all that He had done to Libnah.  [33] Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua struck him and his people, until he had left him no one remaining.\n     [34] Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, to Eglon; and they encamped against it and fought against it.  [35] They took it on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword. He utterly destroyed all the souls who were in it that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.\n     [36] Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron; and they fought against it.  [37] They took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, with its king and all its cities, and all the souls who were in it. He left no one remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it, and all the souls who were in it.\n     [38] Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir, and fought against it.  [39] He took it, with its king and all its cities. They struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls who were in it. He left no one remaining. As he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to its king; as he had done also to Libnah, and to its king.  [40] So Joshua struck all the land, the hill country, the South, the lowland, the slopes, and all their kings. He left no one remaining, but He utterly destroyed all that breathed, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, commanded.  [41] Joshua struck them from Kadesh Barnea even to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon.  [42] Joshua took all these kings and their land at one time because Yahweh, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.  [43] Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.\n"

[4] They went out, they and all their armies with them, many people, even as the sand that is on the seashore in multitude, with very many horses and chariots.  [5] All these kings met together; and they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel.\n     [6] Yahweh said to Joshua, “Don’t be afraid because of them; for tomorrow at this time, I will deliver them up all slain before Israel. You shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire.”\n     [7] So Joshua came suddenly, with all the warriors, against them by the waters of Merom, and attacked them.  [8] Yahweh delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they struck them, and chased them to great Sidon, and to Misrephoth Maim, and to the valley of Mizpah eastward. They struck them until they left them no one remaining.  [9] Joshua did to them as Yahweh told Him. He hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.  [10] Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and struck its king with the sword; for Hazor used to be the head of all those kingdoms.  [11] They struck all the souls who were in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them. There was no one left who breathed. He burned Hazor with fire.  [12] Joshua captured all the cities of those kings, with their kings, and He struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded.  [13] But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them, except Hazor only. Joshua burned that.  [14] The children of Israel took all the plunder of these cities, with the livestock, as plunder for themselves; but every man they struck with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them. They didn’t leave any who breathed.\n     [15] As Yahweh commanded Moses His servant, so Moses commanded Joshua. Joshua did so. He left nothing undone of all that Yahweh commanded Moses.  [16] So Joshua captured all that land, the hill country, all the South, all the land of Goshen, the lowland, the Arabah, the hill country of Israel, and the lowland of the same,  [17] from Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir, even to Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon. He took all their kings, struck them, and put them to death.  [18] Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.  [19] There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon. They took all in battle.  [20] For it was of Yahweh to harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that He might utterly destroy them, that they might have no favor, but that He might destroy them, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  [21] Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel. Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.  [22] There were none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel. Only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, did some remain.  [23] So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that Yahweh spoke to Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. Then the land had rest from war.\n"

I will drive them out from before the children of Israel. Just allocate it to Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded you.  [7] Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.”  [8] With Him the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of Yahweh gave them:  [9] from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba to Dibon;  [10] and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, to the border of the children of Ammon;  [11] and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan to Salecah;  [12] all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (who was left of the remnant of the Rephaim); for Moses attacked these, and drove them out.  [13] Nevertheless the children of Israel didn’t drive out the Geshurites, nor the Maacathites: but Geshur and Maacath live within Israel to this day.  [14] Only He gave no inheritance to the tribe of Levi. The offerings of Yahweh, the God of Israel, made by fire are His inheritance, as He spoke to Him.  [15] Moses gave to the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their families.  [16] Their border was from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain by Medeba;  [17] Heshbon, and all its cities that are in the plain; Dibon, Bamoth Baal, Beth Baal Meon,  [18] Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath,  [19] Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth Shahar in the mount of the valley,  [20] Beth Peor, the slopes of Pisgah, Beth Jeshimoth,  [21] all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses struck with the chiefs of Midian, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the princes of Sihon, who lived in the land.  [22] The children of Israel also killed Balaam the son of Beor, the soothsayer, with the sword, among the rest of their slain.\n     [23] The border of the children of Reuben was the bank of the Jordan. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben according to their families, the cities and its villages.\n     [24] Moses gave to the tribe of Gad, to the children of Gad, according to their families.  [25] Their border was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, to Aroer that is near Rabbah;  [26] and from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir;  [27] and in the valley, Beth Haram, Beth Nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, the Jordan’s bank, to the uttermost part of the sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan eastward.  [28] This is the inheritance of the children of Gad according to their families, the cities and its villages.\n     [29] Moses gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of Manasseh. It was for the half-tribe of the children of Manasseh according to their families.  [30] Their border was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the villages of Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities.  [31] Half Gilead, Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even for the half of the children of Machir according to their families.\n     [32] These are the inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho, eastward.

Now, behold, I am eighty-five years old, today.  [11] As yet I am as strong today as I was in the day that Moses sent me. As my strength was then, even so is my strength now for war, to go out and to come in.  [12] Now therefore give me this hill country, of which Yahweh spoke in that day; for you heard in that day how the Anakim were there, and great and fortified cities. It may be that Yahweh will be with me, and I shall drive them out, as Yahweh said.”\n     [13] Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.  [14] Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because He followed Yahweh, the God of Israel wholeheartedly.  [15] Now the name of Hebron before was Kiriath Arba, after the greatest man among the Anakim. Then the land had rest from war.\n"

These were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families.

[5] Ten parts fell to Manasseh, in addition to the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan;  [6] because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons. The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh.  [7] The border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, which is before Shechem.

They reached to Asher on the north, and to Issachar on the east.

[14] The children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, “Why have you given me just one lot and one part for an inheritance, since we are a numerous people, because Yahweh has blessed us so far?”\n     [15] Joshua said to them, “If you are a numerous people, go up to the forest, and clear land for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim, since the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you.”\n     [16] The children of Joseph said, “The hill country is not enough for us. All the Canaanites who dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both those who are in Beth Shean and its towns, and those who are in the valley of Jezreel.”\n     [17] Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, that is, to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, “You are a numerous people, and have great power.

It went down to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite southward, and went down to En Rogel.

It went out to Cabul on the left hand,  [28] and Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah, even to great Sidon.  [29] The border turned to Ramah, to the fortified city of Tyre; and the border turned to Hosah. It ended at the sea by the region of Achzib;  [30] Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty-two cities with their villages.  [31] This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.\n     [32] The sixth lot came out for the children of Naphtali, even for the children of Naphtali according to their families.  [33] Their border was from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim, Adami-nekeb, and Jabneel, to Lakkum. It ended at the Jordan.  [34] The border turned westward to Aznoth Tabor, and went out from there to Hukkok. It reached to Zebulun on the south, and reached to Asher on the west, and to Judah at the Jordan toward the sunrise.  [35] The fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Chinnereth,  [36] Adamah, Ramah, Hazor,  [37] Kedesh, Edrei, En Hazor,  [38] Iron, Migdal El, Horem, Beth Anath, and Beth Shemesh; nineteen cities with their villages.  [39] This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families, the cities with their villages.\n     [40] The seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families.  [41] The border of their inheritance was Zorah, Eshtaol, Irshemesh,  [42] Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Ithlah,  [43] Elon, Timnah, Ekron,  [44] Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath,  [45] Jehud, Bene Berak, Gath Rimmon,  [46] Me Jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border opposite Joppa.  [47] The border of the children of Dan went out beyond them; for the children of Dan went up and fought against Leshem, and took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and lived therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their forefather.  [48] This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.\n     [49] So they finished distributing the land for inheritance by its borders. The children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them.  [50] According to Yahweh’s commandment, they gave Him the city which He asked, even Timnathserah in the hill country of Ephraim; and He built the city, and lived there.  [51] These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance by lot in Shiloh before Yahweh, at the door of the Tent of Meeting. So they finished dividing the land.\n"

[8] Beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness in the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.

[2] They spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, “Yahweh commanded through Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with their pasture lands for our livestock.”\n     [3] The children of Israel gave to the Levites out of their inheritance, according to the commandment of Yahweh, these cities with their pasture lands.  [4] The lot came out for the families of the Kohathites. The children of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, had thirteen cities by lot out of the tribe of Judah, out of the tribe of the Simeonites, and out of the tribe of Benjamin.

They possessed it, and lived in it.  [44] Yahweh gave them rest all around, according to all that He swore to their fathers. Not a man of all their enemies stood before them. Yahweh delivered all their enemies into their hand.  [45] Nothing failed of any good thing which Yahweh had spoken to the house of Israel. All came to pass.\n"

[3] You have not left your brothers these many days to this day, but have performed the duty of the commandment of Yahweh your God.  [4] Now Yahweh your God has given rest to your brothers, as He spoke to them. Therefore now return and go to your tents, to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave you beyond the Jordan.  [5] Only take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you, to love Yahweh your God, to walk in all His ways, to keep His commandments, to hold fast to Him, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul.”\n     [6] So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away; and they went to their tents.  [7] Now to the one half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given inheritance in Bashan; but Joshua gave to the other half among their brothers beyond the Jordan westward. Moreover when Joshua sent them away to their tents, he blessed them,  [8] and spoke to them, saying, “Return with much wealth to your tents, with very much livestock, with silver, with gold, with bronze, with iron, and with very much clothing. Divide the plunder of your enemies with your brothers.”\n     [9] The children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession, which they owned, according to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.  [10] When they came to the region near the Jordan, that is in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an altar there by the Jordan, a great altar to look at.  [11] The children of Israel heard this, “Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar along the border of the land of Canaan, in the region around the Jordan, on the side that belongs to the children of Israel.”  [12] When the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up against them to war.  [13] The children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest.  [14] With him were ten princes, one prince of a fathers’ house for each of the tribes of Israel; and they were each head of their fathers’ houses among the thousands of Israel.  [15] They came to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying,  [16] “The whole congregation of Yahweh says, ‘What trespass is this that you have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away today from following Yahweh, in that you have built yourselves an altar, to rebel today against Yahweh?  [17] Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day, although there came a plague on the congregation of Yahweh,  [18] that you must turn away today from following Yahweh? It will be, since you rebel today against Yahweh, that tomorrow He will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.  [19] However, if the land of your possession is unclean, then pass over to the land of the possession of Yahweh, in which Yahweh’s tabernacle dwells, and take possession among us; but don’t rebel against Yahweh, nor rebel against us, in building an altar other than Yahweh our God’s altar.  [20] Didn’t Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? That man didn’t perish alone in his iniquity.’”\n     [21] Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and spoke to the heads of the thousands of Israel,  [22] “The Mighty One, God, Yahweh, the Mighty One, God, Yahweh, He knows; and Israel shall know: if it was in rebellion, or if in trespass against Yahweh (don’t save us today),  [23] that we have built us an altar to turn away from following Yahweh; or if to offer burnt offering or meal offering, or if to offer sacrifices of peace offerings, let Yahweh Himself require it.\n     [24] “If we have not out of concern done this, and for a reason, saying, ‘In time to come your children might speak to our children, saying, “What have you to do with Yahweh, the God of Israel?  [25] For Yahweh has made the Jordan a border between us and you, you children of Reuben and children of Gad. You have no portion in Yahweh.”’ So your children might make our children cease from fearing Yahweh.\n     [26] “Therefore we said, ‘Let’s now prepare to build ourselves an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice;  [27] but it will be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we may perform the service of Yahweh before Him with our burnt offerings, with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings;’ that your children may not tell our children in time to come, ‘You have no portion in Yahweh.’\n     [28] “Therefore we said, ‘It shall be, when they tell us or our generations this in time to come, that we shall say, “Behold the pattern of Yahweh’s altar, which our fathers made, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice; but it is a witness between us and you.”’\n     [29] “Far be it from us that we should rebel against Yahweh, and turn away today from following Yahweh, to build an altar for burnt offering, for meal offering, or for sacrifice, besides Yahweh our God’s altar that is before His tabernacle!”\n     [30] When Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation, even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them well.  [31] Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children of Reuben, to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, “Today we know that Yahweh is among us, because you have not committed this trespass against Yahweh. Now you have delivered the children of Israel out of Yahweh’s hand.”  [32] Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.  [33] The thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and spoke no more of going up against them to war, to destroy the land in which the children of Reuben and the children of Gad lived.  [34] The children of Reuben and the children of Gad named the altar “A Witness Between Us that Yahweh is God.”\n"

They served other gods.  [3] I took your father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his offspring, and gave him Isaac.  [4] I gave to Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave to Esau Mount Seir, to possess it. Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.\n     [5] “‘I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.  [6] I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and you came to the sea. The Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and with horsemen to the Red Sea.  [7] When they cried out to Yahweh, He put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea on them, and covered them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt. You lived in the wilderness many days.\n     [8] “‘I brought you into the land of the Amorites, that lived beyond the Jordan. They fought with you, and I gave them into your hand. You possessed their land, and I destroyed them from before you.  [9] Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel. He sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you,  [10] but I would not listen to Balaam; therefore he blessed you still. So I delivered you out of his hand.\n     [11] “‘You went over the Jordan, and came to Jericho. The men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I delivered them into your hand.  [12] I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; not with your sword, nor with your bow.  [13] I gave you a land on which you had not labored, and cities which you didn’t build, and you live in them. You eat of vineyards and olive groves which you didn’t plant.’\n     [14] “Now therefore fear Yahweh, and serve Him in sincerity and in truth. Put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River, in Egypt; and serve Yahweh.  [15] If it seems evil to you to serve Yahweh, choose today whom you will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell; but as for me and my house, we will serve Yahweh.”\n     [16] The people answered, “Far be it from us that we should forsake Yahweh, to serve other gods;  [17] for it is Yahweh our God who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and who did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way in which we went, and among all the peoples through the middle of whom we passed.  [18] Yahweh drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites who lived in the land. Therefore we also will serve Yahweh; for He is our God.”\n     [19] Joshua said to the people, “You can’t serve Yahweh, for He is a holy God. He is a jealous God. He will not forgive your disobedience nor your sins.  [20] If you forsake Yahweh, and serve foreign gods, then He will turn and do you evil, and consume you, after He has done you good.”\n     [21] The people said to Joshua, “No, but we will serve Yahweh.”  [22] Joshua said to the people, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen Yahweh yourselves, to serve Him.”\n    They said, “We are witnesses.”\n     [23] “Now therefore put away the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your heart to Yahweh, the God of Israel.”\n     [24] The people said to Joshua, “We will serve Yahweh our God, and we will listen to His voice.”\n     [25] So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and made for them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.  [26] Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and He took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Yahweh.  [27] Joshua said to all the people, “Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us, for it has heard all Yahweh’s words which He spoke to us. It shall be therefore a witness against you, lest you deny your God.”  [28] So Joshua sent the people away, each to his own inheritance.\n     [29] After these things, Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Yahweh, died, being one hundred ten years old.  [30] They buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.  [31] Israel served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, and had known all the work of Yahweh, that He had worked for Israel.  [32] They buried the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, in Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of silver. They became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.  [33] Eleazar the son of Aaron died. They buried him in the hill of Phinehas his son, which was given him in the hill country of Ephraim.\n"

Behold, I have delivered the land into His hand.”\n     [3] Judah said to Simeon his brother, “Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with you into your lot.” So Simeon went with him.  [4] Judah went up, and Yahweh delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand. They struck ten thousand men in Bezek.  [5] They found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek, and they fought against him. They struck the Canaanites and the Perizzites.  [6] But Adoni-Bezek fled. They pursued him, caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his big toes.  [7] Adoni-Bezek said, “Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their big toes cut off, scavenged under my table. As I have done, so God has done to me.” They brought Him to Jerusalem, and He died there.  [8] The children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, took it, struck it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.\n     [9] After that, the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, and in the South, and in the lowland.  [10] Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron. (The name of Hebron before that was Kiriath Arba.) They struck Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.\n     [11] From there he went against the inhabitants of Debir. (The name of Debir before that was Kiriath Sepher.)  [12] Caleb said, “I will give Achsah my daughter as wife to the man who strikes Kiriath Sepher, and takes it.”  [13] Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it, so he gave him Achsah his daughter as his wife.\n     [14] When she came, she got him to ask her father for a field. She got off her donkey; and Caleb said to her, “What would you like?”\n     [15] She said to him, “Give me a blessing; because you have set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water.” Then Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.  [16] The children of the Kenite, Moses’ brother-in-law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad; and they went and lived with the people.  [17] Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they struck the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. The name of the city was called Hormah.  [18] Also Judah took Gaza with its border, and Ashkelon with its border, and Ekron with its border.  [19] Yahweh was with Judah, and drove out the inhabitants of the hill country; for He could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.  [20] They gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had said, and he drove the three sons of Anak out of there.  [21] The children of Benjamin didn’t drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem, but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.\n     [22] The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and Yahweh was with them.  [23] The house of Joseph sent to spy out Bethel. (The name of the city before that was Luz.)  [24] The watchers saw a man come out of the city, and they said to him, “Please show us the entrance into the city, and we will deal kindly with you.”  [25] He showed them the entrance into the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man and all his family go.  [26] The man went into the land of the Hittites, built a city, and called its name Luz, which is its name to this day.\n     [27] Manasseh didn’t drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shean and its towns, nor Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.  [28] When Israel had grown strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, and didn’t utterly drive them out.  [29] Ephraim didn’t drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, but the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them.  [30] Zebulun didn’t drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites lived among them, and became subject to forced labor.  [31] Asher didn’t drive out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants of Sidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob;  [32] but the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, for they didn’t drive them out.  [33] Naphtali didn’t drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth Anath; but he lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. Nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and of Beth Anath became subject to forced labor.  [34] The Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill country, for they would not allow them to come down to the valley;  [35] but the Amorites would dwell in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim. Yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became subject to forced labor.  [36] The border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.\n"

I said, ‘I will never break my covenant with you.  [2] You shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land. You shall break down their altars.’ But you have not listened to my voice. Why have you done this?  [3] Therefore I also said, ‘I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be in your sides, and their gods will be a snare to you.’”\n     [4] When Yahweh’s angel spoke these words to all the children of Israel, the people lifted up their voice and wept.  [5] They called the name of that place Bochim, and they sacrificed there to Yahweh.  [6] Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the children of Israel each went to his inheritance to possess the land.  [7] The people served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of Yahweh that He had worked for Israel.  [8] Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Yahweh, died, being one hundred ten years old.  [9] They buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath Heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.  [10] After all that generation were gathered to their fathers, another generation arose after them who didn’t know Yahweh, nor the work which He had done for Israel.  [11] The children of Israel did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and served the Baals.  [12] They abandoned Yahweh, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the peoples who were around them, and bowed themselves down to them; and they provoked Yahweh to anger.  [13] They abandoned Yahweh, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.  [14] Yahweh’s anger burned against Israel, and He delivered them into the hands of raiders who plundered them. He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, so that they could no longer stand before their enemies.  [15] Wherever they went out, Yahweh’s hand was against them for evil, as Yahweh had spoken, and as Yahweh had sworn to them; and they were very distressed.  [16] Yahweh raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those who plundered them.  [17] Yet they didn’t listen to their judges; for they prostituted themselves to other gods, and bowed themselves down to them. They quickly turned away from the way in which their fathers walked, obeying Yahweh’s commandments. They didn’t do so.  [18] When Yahweh raised up judges for them, then Yahweh was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for it grieved Yahweh because of their groaning by reason of those who oppressed them and troubled them.  [19] But when the judge was dead, they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their fathers in following other gods to serve them and to bow down to them. They didn’t cease what they were doing, or give up their stubborn ways.  [20] Yahweh’s anger burned against Israel; and He said, “Because this nation transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and has not listened to my voice,  [21] I also will no longer drive out any of the nations that Joshua left when he died from before them;  [22] that by them I may test Israel, to see if they will keep Yahweh’s way to walk therein, as their fathers kept it, or not.”  [23] So Yahweh left those nations, without driving them out hastily. He didn’t deliver them into Joshua’s hand.\n"

[4] They were left to test Israel by them, to know whether they would listen to Yahweh’s commandments, which He commanded their fathers by Moses.  [5] The children of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.  [6] They took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods.  [7] The children of Israel did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and forgot Yahweh their God, and served the Baals and the Asheroth.  [8] Therefore Yahweh’s anger burned against Israel, and He sold them into the hand of Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia; and the children of Israel served Cushan Rishathaim eight years.  [9] When the children of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised up a savior to the children of Israel, who saved them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother.  [10] Yahweh’s Spirit came on Him, and He judged Israel; and He went out to war, and Yahweh delivered Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into His hand. His hand prevailed against Cushan Rishathaim.  [11] The land had rest forty years, then Othniel the son of Kenaz died.\n     [12] The children of Israel again did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and Yahweh strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight.  [13] He gathered the children of Ammon and Amalek to himself; and he went and struck Israel, and they possessed the city of palm trees.  [14] The children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.  [15] But when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised up a savior for them: Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a left-handed man. The children of Israel sent tribute by Him to Eglon the king of Moab.  [16] Ehud made himself a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length; and he wore it under his clothing on his right thigh.  [17] He offered the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man.  [18] When Ehud had finished offering the tribute, he sent away the people who carried the tribute.  [19] But he himself turned back from the stone idols that were by Gilgal, and said, “I have a secret message for you, O king.”\n    The king said, “Keep silence!” All who stood by him left him.\n     [20] Ehud came to Him; and He was sitting by Himself alone in the cool upper room. Ehud said, “I have a message from God to you.” He arose out of His seat.  [21] Ehud put out his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body.  [22] The handle also went in after the blade; and the fat closed on the blade, for he didn’t draw the sword out of his body; and it came out behind.  [23] Then Ehud went out onto the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room on him, and locked them.\n     [24] After he had gone, his servants came and saw that the doors of the upper room were locked. They said, “Surely he is covering his feet in the upper room.”  [25] They waited until they were ashamed; and behold, he didn’t open the doors of the upper room. Therefore they took the key and opened them, and behold, their lord had fallen down dead on the floor.\n     [26] Ehud escaped while they waited, passed beyond the stone idols, and escaped to Seirah.  [27] When he had come, he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he led them.\n     [28] He said to them, “Follow me; for Yahweh has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.” They followed Him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and didn’t allow any man to pass over.  [29] They struck at that time about ten thousand men of Moab, every strong man and every man of valor. No man escaped.  [30] So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. Then the land had rest eighty years.\n     [31] After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck six hundred men of the Philistines with an ox goad. He also saved Israel.\n"

[2] Yahweh sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth of the Gentiles.  [3] The children of Israel cried to Yahweh, for He had nine hundred chariots of iron; and He mightily oppressed the children of Israel for twenty years.  [4] Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, judged Israel at that time.  [5] She lived under Deborah’s palm tree between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.  [6] She sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh Naphtali, and said to Him, “Hasn’t Yahweh, the God of Israel, commanded, ‘Go and lead the way to Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?  [7] I will draw to you, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into your hand.’”\n     [8] Barak said to her, “If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.”\n     [9] She said, “I will surely go with you. Nevertheless, the journey that you take won’t be for your honor; for Yahweh will sell Sisera into a woman’s hand.” Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.\n     [10] Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh. Ten thousand men followed him; and Deborah went up with him.  [11] Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab, Moses’ brother-in-law, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh.  [12] They told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor.  [13] Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, to the river Kishon.\n     [14] Deborah said to Barak, “Go; for this is the day in which Yahweh has delivered Sisera into your hand. Hasn’t Yahweh gone out before you?” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after Him.  [15] Yahweh confused Sisera, all His chariots, and all His army, with the edge of the sword before Barak. Sisera abandoned His chariot and fled away on His feet.  [16] But Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth of the Gentiles; and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword. There was not a man left.\n     [17] However Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.  [18] Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, “Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; don’t be afraid.” He came in to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.\n     [19] He said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink; for I am thirsty.”\n    She opened a container of milk, and gave him a drink, and covered him.\n     [20] He said to her, “Stand in the door of the tent, and if any man comes and inquires of you, and says, ‘Is there any man here?’ you shall say, ‘No.’”\n     [21] Then Jael, Heber’s wife, took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and struck the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground, for he was in a deep sleep; so he fainted and died.  [22] Behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, “Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek.” He came to her; and behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent peg was in his temples.  [23] So God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel on that day.  [24] The hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.\n"

[3] So it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites, the Amalekites, and the children of the east came up against them.  [4] They encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, until you come to Gaza. They left no sustenance in Israel, and no sheep, ox, or donkey.  [5] For they came up with their livestock and their tents. They came in as locusts for multitude. Both they and their camels were without number; and they came into the land to destroy it.  [6] Israel was brought very low because of Midian; and the children of Israel cried to Yahweh.\n     [7] When the children of Israel cried to Yahweh because of Midian,  [8] Yahweh sent a prophet to the children of Israel; and He said to them, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you out of the house of bondage.  [9] I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land.  [10] I said to you, “I am Yahweh your God. You shall not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell.” But you have not listened to my voice.’”\n     [11] Yahweh’s angel came and sat under the oak which was in Ophrah, that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite. His son Gideon was beating out wheat in the wine press, to hide it from the Midianites.  [12] Yahweh’s angel appeared to Him, and said to Him, “Yahweh is with you, you mighty man of valor!”\n     [13] Gideon said to Him, “Oh, my lord, if Yahweh is with us, why then has all this happened to us? Where are all His wondrous works which our fathers told us of, saying, ‘Didn’t Yahweh bring us up from Egypt?’ But now Yahweh has cast us off, and delivered us into the hand of Midian.”\n     [14] Yahweh looked at Him, and said, “Go in this your might, and save Israel from the hand of Midian. Haven’t I sent you?”\n     [15] He said to him, “O Lord, how shall I save Israel? Behold, my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house.”\n     [16] Yahweh said to Him, “Surely I will be with you, and you shall strike the Midianites as one man.”\n     [17] He said to him, “If now I have found favor in your sight, then show me a sign that it is you who talk with me.  [18] Please don’t go away until I come to you, and bring out my present, and lay it before you.”\n    He said, “I will wait until you come back.”\n     [19] Gideon went in and prepared a young goat and unleavened cakes of an ephah of meal. He put the meat in a basket and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out to him under the oak, and presented it.\n     [20] The angel of God said to Him, “Take the meat and the unleavened cakes, and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth.”\n    He did so.  [21] Then Yahweh’s angel stretched out the end of the staff that was in His hand, and touched the meat and the unleavened cakes; and fire went up out of the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened cakes. Then Yahweh’s angel departed out of His sight.\n     [22] Gideon saw that He was Yahweh’s angel; and Gideon said, “Alas, Lord Yahweh! Because I have seen Yahweh’s angel face to face!”\n     [23] Yahweh said to Him, “Peace be to you! Don’t be afraid. You shall not die.”\n     [24] Then Gideon built an altar there to Yahweh, and called it “Yahweh is Peace.” To this day it is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.\n     [25] That same night, Yahweh said to Him, “Take your father’s bull, even the second bull seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the Asherah that is by it.  [26] Then build an altar to Yahweh your God on the top of this stronghold, in an orderly way, and take the second bull, and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah which you shall cut down.”\n     [27] Then Gideon took ten men of His servants, and did as Yahweh had spoken to Him. Because He feared His father’s household and the men of the city, He could not do it by day, but He did it by night.\n     [28] When the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah was cut down that was by it, and the second bull was offered on the altar that was built.  [29] They said to one another, “Who has done this thing?”\n    When they inquired and asked, they said, “Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.”\n     [30] Then the men of the city said to Joash, “Bring out your son, that he may die, because he has broken down the altar of Baal, and because he has cut down the Asherah that was by it.”  [31] Joash said to all who stood against Him, “Will you contend for Baal? Or will you save Him? He who will contend for Him, let Him be put to death by morning! If He is a god, let Him contend for Himself, because someone has broken down His altar!”  [32] Therefore on that day he named him Jerub-Baal, saying, “Let Baal contend against him, because he has broken down his altar.”\n     [33] Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east assembled themselves together; and they passed over, and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.  [34] But Yahweh’s Spirit came on Gideon, and He blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered together to follow Him.  [35] He sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, and they also were gathered together to follow him. He sent messengers to Asher, to Zebulun, and to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.\n     [36] Gideon said to God, “If you will save Israel by my hand, as you have spoken,  [37] behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece only, and it is dry on all the ground, then I’ll know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you have spoken.”\n     [38] It was so; for he rose up early on the next day, and pressed the fleece together, and wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.\n     [39] Gideon said to God, “Don’t let your anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once. Please let me make a trial just this once with the fleece. Let it now be dry only on the fleece, and on all the ground let there be dew.”\n     [40] God did so that night; for it was dry on the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.\n"

It shall be, that those whom I tell you, ‘This shall go with you,’ shall go with you; and whoever I tell you, ‘This shall not go with you,’ shall not go.”  [5] So He brought down the people to the water; and Yahweh said to Gideon, “Everyone who laps of the water with His tongue, like a dog laps, you shall set Him by Himself; likewise everyone who bows down on His knees to drink.”  [6] The number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water.  [7] Yahweh said to Gideon, “I will save you by the three hundred men who lapped, and deliver the Midianites into your hand. Let all the other people go, each to His own place.”\n     [8] So the people took food in their hand, and their trumpets; and he sent all the rest of the men of Israel to their own tents, but retained the three hundred men; and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.  [9] That same night, Yahweh said to Him, “Arise, go down into the camp, for I have delivered it into your hand.  [10] But if you are afraid to go down, go with Purah your servant down to the camp.  [11] You will hear what they say; and afterward your hands will be strengthened to go down into the camp.” Then went he down with Purah his servant to the outermost part of the armed men who were in the camp.\n     [12] The Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is on the seashore for multitude.\n     [13] When Gideon had come, behold, there was a man telling a dream to his fellow. He said, “Behold, I dreamed a dream; and behold, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, came to the tent, and struck it so that it fell, and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat.”\n     [14] His fellow answered, “This is nothing other than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel. God has delivered Midian into His hand, with all the army.”\n     [15] It was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, that He worshiped. Then He returned into the camp of Israel and said, “Arise, for Yahweh has delivered the army of Midian into your hand!”\n     [16] He divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put into the hands of all of them trumpets and empty pitchers, with torches within the pitchers.\n     [17] He said to them, “Watch me, and do likewise. Behold, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so you shall do.  [18] When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and shout, ‘For Yahweh and for Gideon!’”\n     [19] So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch. Then they blew the trumpets and broke in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands.  [20] The three companies blew the trumpets, broke the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands with which to blow; and they shouted, “The sword of Yahweh and of Gideon!”  [21] They each stood in his place around the camp, and all the army ran; and they shouted, and put them to flight.  [22] They blew the three hundred trumpets, and Yahweh set every man’s sword against His fellow and against all the army; and the army fled as far as Beth Shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel Meholah, by Tabbath.  [23] The men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued Midian.  [24] Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, “Come down against Midian and take the waters before them as far as Beth Barah, even the Jordan!” So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together and took the waters as far as Beth Barah, even the Jordan.  [25] They took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at Oreb’s rock, and Zeeb they killed at Zeeb’s wine press, as they pursued Midian. Then they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.\n"

[2] He said to them, “What have I now done in comparison with you? Isn’t the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?  [3] God has delivered into your hand the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb! What was I able to do in comparison with you?” Then their anger was abated toward Him when He had said that.\n     [4] Gideon came to the Jordan and passed over, he and the three hundred men who were with him, faint, yet pursuing.  [5] He said to the men of Succoth, “Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me; for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.”\n     [6] The princes of Succoth said, “Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?”\n     [7] Gideon said, “Therefore when Yahweh has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.”\n     [8] He went up there to Penuel, and spoke to them in the same way; and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.  [9] He spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, “When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.”\n     [10] Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their armies with them, about fifteen thousand men, all who were left of all the army of the children of the east; for there fell one hundred twenty thousand men who drew sword.  [11] Gideon went up by the way of those who lived in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and struck the army; for the army felt secure.  [12] Zebah and Zalmunna fled and he pursued them. He took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and confused all the army.  [13] Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from the ascent of Heres.  [14] He caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him; and he described for him the princes of Succoth, and its elders, seventy-seven men.  [15] He came to the men of Succoth, and said, “See Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom you taunted me, saying, ‘Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your men who are weary?’”  [16] He took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.  [17] He broke down the tower of Penuel, and killed the men of the city.\n     [18] Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, “What kind of men were they whom you killed at Tabor?”\n    They answered, “They were like you. They all resembled the children of a king.”\n     [19] He said, “They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As Yahweh lives, if you had saved them alive, I would not kill you.”\n     [20] He said to Jether his firstborn, “Get up and kill them!” But the youth didn’t draw his sword; for he was afraid, because he was yet a youth.\n     [21] Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, “You rise and fall on us; for as the man is, so is his strength.” Gideon arose, and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescents that were on their camels’ necks.\n     [22] Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, “Rule over us, both you, your son, and your son’s son also; for you have saved us out of the hand of Midian.”\n     [23] Gideon said to them, “I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you. Yahweh shall rule over you.”  [24] Gideon said to them, “I do have a request: that you would each give me the earrings of his plunder.” (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)\n     [25] They answered, “We will willingly give them.” They spread a garment, and every man threw the earrings of his plunder into it.  [26] The weight of the golden earrings that he requested was one thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold, in addition to the crescents, and the pendants, and the purple clothing that was on the kings of Midian, and in addition to the chains that were about their camels’ necks.  [27] Gideon made an ephod out of it, and put it in Ophrah, his city. Then all Israel played the prostitute with it there; and it became a snare to Gideon and to his house.  [28] So Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. The land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon.\n     [29] Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and lived in his own house.  [30] Gideon had seventy sons conceived from his body, for he had many wives.  [31] His concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son, and he named him Abimelech.  [32] Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.\n     [33] As soon as Gideon was dead, the children of Israel turned again and played the prostitute following the Baals, and made Baal Berith their god.  [34] The children of Israel didn’t remember Yahweh their God, who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side;  [35] neither did they show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, that is, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shown to Israel.\n"

Their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, “He is our brother.”  [4] They gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Baal Berith, with which Abimelech hired vain and reckless fellows who followed him.  [5] He went to his father’s house at Ophrah, and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, being seventy persons, on one stone; but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left, for he hid himself.  [6] All the men of Shechem assembled themselves together with all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king by the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem.  [7] When they told it to Jotham, He went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim and lifted up His voice, cried out, and said to them, “Listen to me, you men of Shechem, that God may listen to you.  [8] The trees set out to anoint a king over themselves. They said to the olive tree, ‘Reign over us.’\n     [9] “But the olive tree said to them, ‘Should I stop producing my oil, with which they honor God and man by me, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?’\n     [10] “The trees said to the fig tree, ‘Come and reign over us.’\n     [11] “But the fig tree said to them, ‘Should I leave my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?’\n     [12] “The trees said to the vine, ‘Come and reign over us.’\n     [13] “The vine said to them, ‘Should I leave my new wine, which cheers God and man, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?’\n     [14] “Then all the trees said to the bramble, ‘Come and reign over us.’\n     [15] “The bramble said to the trees, ‘If in truth you anoint me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade; and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.’\n     [16] “Now therefore, if you have dealt truly and righteously, in that you have made Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him according to the deserving of his hands  [17] (for my father fought for you, risked his life, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian;  [18] and you have risen up against my father’s house today and have slain his sons, seventy persons, on one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his female servant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother);  [19] if you then have dealt truly and righteously with Jerubbaal and with his house today, then rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you;  [20] but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech and devour the men of Shechem and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem and from the house of Millo and devour Abimelech.”\n     [21] Jotham ran away and fled, and went to Beer and lived there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.\n     [22] Abimelech was prince over Israel three years.  [23] Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech,  [24] that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and that their blood might be laid on Abimelech their brother who killed them, and on the men of Shechem who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers.  [25] The men of Shechem set an ambush for him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all who came along that way by them; and Abimelech was told about it.\n     [26] Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers and went over to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him.  [27] They went out into the field, harvested their vineyards, trod the grapes, celebrated, and went into the house of their god and ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech.  [28] Gaal the son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Isn’t he the son of Jerubbaal? Isn’t Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem, but why should we serve him?  [29] I wish that this people were under my hand! Then I would remove Abimelech.” He said to Abimelech, “Increase your army and come out!”\n     [30] When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger burned.  [31] He sent messengers to Abimelech craftily, saying, “Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem; and behold, they incite the city against you.  [32] Now therefore, go up by night, you and the people who are with you, and lie in wait in the field.  [33] It shall be that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, you shall rise early and rush on the city. Behold, when he and the people who are with him come out against you, then may you do to them as you shall find occasion.”\n     [34] Abimelech rose up, and all the people who were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.  [35] Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city. Abimelech rose up, and the people who were with him, from the ambush.\n     [36] When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, “Behold, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains.”\n    Zebul said to him, “You see the shadows of the mountains as if they were men.”\n     [37] Gaal spoke again and said, “Behold, people are coming down by the middle of the land, and one company comes by the way of the oak of Meonenim.”\n     [38] Then Zebul said to him, “Now where is your mouth, that you said, ‘Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?’ Isn’t this the people that you have despised? Please go out now and fight with them.”\n     [39] Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.  [40] Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many fell wounded, even to the entrance of the gate.  [41] Abimelech lived at Arumah; and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brothers, that they should not dwell in Shechem.  [42] On the next day, the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.  [43] He took the people and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field; and he looked, and behold, the people came out of the city. So, he rose up against them and struck them.  [44] Abimelech and the companies that were with him rushed forward and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city; and the two companies rushed on all who were in the field and struck them.  [45] Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city and killed the people in it. He beat down the city and sowed it with salt.\n     [46] When all the men of the tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered into the stronghold of the house of Elberith.  [47] Abimelech was told that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.  [48] Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people who were with him; and Abimelech took an ax in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up, and laid it on his shoulder. Then he said to the people who were with him, “What you have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done!”  [49] All the people likewise each cut down his bough, followed Abimelech, and put them at the base of the stronghold, and set the stronghold on fire over them, so that all the people of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.  [50] Then Abimelech went to Thebez and encamped against Thebez, and took it.  [51] But there was a strong tower within the city, and all the men and women of the city fled there, and shut themselves in, and went up to the roof of the tower.  [52] Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it, and came near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.  [53] A certain woman cast an upper millstone on Abimelech’s head, and broke his skull.\n     [54] Then he called hastily to the young man, his armor bearer, and said to him, “Draw your sword and kill me, that men not say of me, ‘A woman killed him.’ His young man thrust him through, and he died.”\n     [55] When the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they each departed to his place.  [56] Thus God repaid the wickedness of Abimelech, which He did to His father in killing His seventy brothers;  [57] and God repaid all the wickedness of the men of Shechem on their heads; and the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal came on them.\n"

[2] He judged Israel twenty-three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.\n     [3] After him Jair, the Gileadite, arose. He judged Israel twenty-two years.  [4] He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkey colts. They had thirty cities, which are called Havvoth Jair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.  [5] Jair died, and was buried in Kamon.\n     [6] The children of Israel again did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and served the Baals, the Ashtaroth, the gods of Syria, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines. They abandoned Yahweh, and didn’t serve Him.  [7] Yahweh’s anger burned against Israel, and He sold them into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the children of Ammon.  [8] They troubled and oppressed the children of Israel that year. For eighteen years they oppressed all the children of Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.  [9] The children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was very distressed.  [10] The children of Israel cried to Yahweh, saying, “We have sinned against you, even because we have forsaken our God, and have served the Baals.”\n     [11] Yahweh said to the children of Israel, “Didn’t I save you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?  [12] The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, oppressed you; and you cried to me, and I saved you out of their hand.  [13] Yet you have forsaken me and served other gods. Therefore I will save you no more.  [14] Go and cry to the gods which you have chosen. Let them save you in the time of your distress!”\n     [15] The children of Israel said to Yahweh, “We have sinned! Do to us whatever seems good to you; only deliver us, please, today.”  [16] They put away the foreign gods from among them and served Yahweh; and His soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.\n     [17] Then the children of Ammon were gathered together and encamped in Gilead. The children of Israel assembled themselves together and encamped in Mizpah.

When his wife’s sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out and said to him, “You will not inherit in our father’s house, for you are the son of another woman.”  [3] Then Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob. Outlaws joined up with Jephthah, and they went out with him.\n     [4] After a while, the children of Ammon made war against Israel.  [5] When the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah out of the land of Tob.  [6] They said to Jephthah, “Come and be our chief, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.”\n     [7] Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “Didn’t you hate me, and drive me out of my father’s house? Why have you come to me now when you are in distress?”\n     [8] The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “Therefore we have turned again to you now, that you may go with us and fight with the children of Ammon. You will be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”\n     [9] Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “If you bring me home again to fight with the children of Ammon, and Yahweh delivers them before me, will I be your head?”\n     [10] The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “Yahweh will be witness between us. Surely we will do what you say.”\n     [11] Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made Him head and chief over them. Jephthah spoke all His words before Yahweh in Mizpah.\n     [12] Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, “What do you have to do with me, that you have come to me to fight against my land?”\n     [13] The king of the children of Ammon answered the messengers of Jephthah, “Because Israel took away my land when he came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and to the Jordan. Now therefore restore that territory again peaceably.”\n     [14] Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon;  [15] and he said to him, “Jephthah says: Israel didn’t take away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon;  [16] but when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh,  [17] then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, ‘Please let me pass through your land;’ but the king of Edom didn’t listen. In the same way, he sent to the king of Moab, but he refused; so Israel stayed in Kadesh.  [18] Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other side of the Arnon; but they didn’t come within the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab.  [19] Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, ‘Please let us pass through your land to my place.’  [20] But Sihon didn’t trust Israel to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.  [21] Yahweh, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all His people into the hand of Israel, and they struck them. So Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.  [22] They possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to the Jordan.  [23] So now Yahweh, the God of Israel, has dispossessed the Amorites from before His people Israel, and should you possess them?  [24] Won’t you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whoever Yahweh our God has dispossessed from before us, them will we possess.  [25] Now are you anything better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them?  [26] Israel lived in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along the side of the Arnon for three hundred years! Why didn’t you recover them within that time?  [27] Therefore I have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong to war against me. May Yahweh the Judge be judge today between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.”\n     [28] However, the king of the children of Ammon didn’t listen to the words of Jephthah which he sent him.  [29] Then Yahweh’s Spirit came on Jephthah, and He passed over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpah of Gilead, and from Mizpah of Gilead He passed over to the children of Ammon.\n     [30] Jephthah vowed a vow to Yahweh, and said, “If you will indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand,  [31] then it shall be, that whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be Yahweh’s, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.”\n     [32] So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and Yahweh delivered them into His hand.  [33] He struck them from Aroer until you come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and to Abelcheramim, with a very great slaughter. So the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.\n     [34] Jephthah came to Mizpah to his house; and behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances. She was his only child. Besides her he had neither son nor daughter.  [35] When He saw her, He tore His clothes, and said, “Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low, and you are one of those who trouble me; for I have opened my mouth to Yahweh, and I can’t go back.”\n     [36] She said to Him, “My father, you have opened your mouth to Yahweh; do to me according to that which has proceeded out of your mouth, because Yahweh has taken vengeance for you on your enemies, even on the children of Ammon.”  [37] Then she said to her father, “Let this thing be done for me. Leave me alone two months, that I may depart and go down on the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions.”\n     [38] He said, “Go.” He sent her away for two months; and she departed, she and her companions, and mourned her virginity on the mountains.  [39] At the end of two months, she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed. She was a virgin. It became a custom in Israel  [40] that the daughters of Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.\n"

We will burn your house around you with fire!”\n     [2] Jephthah said to them, “I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, you didn’t save me out of their hand.  [3] When I saw that you didn’t save me, I put my life in my hand, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and Yahweh delivered them into my hand. Why then have you come up to me today, to fight against me?”\n     [4] Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim. The men of Gilead struck Ephraim, because they said, “You are fugitives of Ephraim, you Gileadites, in the middle of Ephraim, and in the middle of Manasseh.”  [5] The Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. Whenever a fugitive of Ephraim said, “Let me go over,” the men of Gilead said to him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he said, “No;”  [6] then they said to him, “Now say ‘Shibboleth;’” and he said “Sibboleth”; for he couldn’t manage to pronounce it correctly, then they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. At that time, forty-two thousand of Ephraim fell.\n     [7] Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died, and was buried in the cities of Gilead.\n     [8] After him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.  [9] He had thirty sons.

[14] He had forty sons and thirty sons’ sons who rode on seventy donkey colts. He judged Israel eight years.

          "content": "     [1] The children of Israel again did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight; and Yahweh delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.\n     [2] There was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and childless.  [3] Yahweh’s angel appeared to the woman, and said to her, “See now, you are barren and childless; but you shall conceive and bear a son.  [4] Now therefore please beware and drink no wine nor strong drink, and don’t eat any unclean thing;  [5] for, behold, you shall conceive and give birth to a son. No razor shall come on His head, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb. He shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.”\n     [6] Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, “A man of God came to me, and His face was like the face of the angel of God, very awesome. I didn’t ask Him where He was from, neither did He tell me His name;  [7] but He said to me, ‘Behold, you shall conceive and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink. Don’t eat any unclean thing, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of His death.’”\n     [8] Then Manoah entreated Yahweh, and said, “Oh, Lord, please let the man of God whom you sent come again to us, and teach us what we should do to the child who shall be born.”\n     [9] God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field; but Manoah, her husband, wasn’t with her.  [10] The woman hurried and ran, and told her husband, saying to him, “Behold, the man who came to me that day has appeared to me.”\n     [11] Manoah arose and followed his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, “Are you the man who spoke to my wife?”\n    He said, “I am.”\n     [12] Manoah said, “Now let your words happen. What shall the child’s way of life and mission be?”\n     [13] Yahweh’s angel said to Manoah, “Of all that I said to the woman let her beware.  [14] She may not eat of anything that comes of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing. Let her observe all that I commanded her.”\n     [15] Manoah said to Yahweh’s angel, “Please stay with us, that we may make a young goat ready for you.”\n     [16] Yahweh’s angel said to Manoah, “Though you detain me, I won’t eat your bread. If you will prepare a burnt offering, you must offer it to Yahweh.” For Manoah didn’t know that He was Yahweh’s angel.\n     [17] Manoah said to Yahweh’s angel, “What is your name, that when your words happen, we may honor you?”\n     [18] Yahweh’s angel said to Him, “Why do you ask about my name, since it is incomprehensible?”\n     [19] So Manoah took the young goat with the meal offering, and offered it on the rock to Yahweh. Then the angel did an amazing thing as Manoah and His wife watched.  [20] For when the flame went up toward the sky from off the altar, Yahweh’s angel ascended in the flame of the altar. Manoah and His wife watched; and they fell on their faces to the ground.  [21] But Yahweh’s angel didn’t appear to Manoah or to His wife any more. Then Manoah knew that He was Yahweh’s angel.  [22] Manoah said to His wife, “We shall surely die, because we have seen God.”\n     [23] But His wife said to Him, “If Yahweh were pleased to kill us, He wouldn’t have received a burnt offering and a meal offering at our hand, and He wouldn’t have shown us all these things, nor would He have told us such things as these at this time.”  [24] The woman bore a son and named Him Samson. The child grew, and Yahweh blessed Him.  [25] Yahweh’s Spirit began to move Him in Mahaneh Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.\n"

[2] He came up, and told his father and his mother, saying, “I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines. Now therefore get her for me as my wife.”\n     [3] Then his father and his mother said to him, “Isn’t there a woman among your brothers’ daughters, or among all my people, that you go to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines?”\n    Samson said to his father, “Get her for me, for she pleases me well.”\n     [4] But His father and His mother didn’t know that it was of Yahweh; for He sought an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines ruled over Israel.\n     [5] Then Samson went down to Timnah with his father and his mother, and came to the vineyards of Timnah; and behold, a young lion roared at him.  [6] Yahweh’s Spirit came mightily on Him, and He tore Him as He would have torn a young goat with His bare hands, but He didn’t tell His father or His mother what He had done.  [7] He went down and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson well.  [8] After a while he returned to take her, and he went over to see the carcass of the lion; and behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.  [9] He took it into his hands, and went on, eating as he went. He came to his father and mother and gave to them, and they ate, but he didn’t tell them that he had taken the honey out of the lion’s body.  [10] His father went down to the woman; and Samson made a feast there, for the young men used to do so.  [11] When they saw him, they brought thirty companions to be with him.\n     [12] Samson said to them, “Let me tell you a riddle now. If you can tell me the answer within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing;  [13] but if you can’t tell me the answer, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing.”\n    They said to him, “Tell us your riddle, that we may hear it.”\n     [14] He said to them,\n  “Out of the eater came out food.\n    Out of the strong came out sweetness.”\n    They couldn’t in three days declare the riddle.  [15] On the seventh day, they said to Samson’s wife, “Entice your husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn you and your father’s house with fire. Have you called us to impoverish us? Isn’t that so?”\n     [16] Samson’s wife wept before him, and said, “You just hate me, and don’t love me. You’ve told a riddle to the children of my people, and haven’t told it to me.”\n    He said to her, “Behold, I haven’t told my father or my mother, so why should I tell you?”\n     [17] She wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted; and on the seventh day, he told her, because she pressed him severely; and she told the riddle to the children of her people.  [18] The men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, “What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?”\n    He said to them,\n  “If you hadn’t plowed with my heifer,\n    you wouldn’t have found out my riddle.”\n     [19] Yahweh’s Spirit came mightily on Him, and He went down to Ashkelon and struck thirty men of them. He took their plunder, then gave the changes of clothing to those who declared the riddle. His anger burned, and He went up to His father’s house.  [20] But Samson’s wife was given to his companion, who had been his friend.\n"

He said, “I will go in to my wife’s room.”\n    But her father wouldn’t allow him to go in.  [2] Her father said, “I most certainly thought that you utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to your companion. Isn’t her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please, take her instead.”\n     [3] Samson said to them, “This time I will be blameless in the case of the Philistines when I harm them.”  [4] Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned tail to tail, and put a torch in the middle between every two tails.  [5] When he had set the torches on fire, he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burned up both the shocks and the standing grain, and also the olive groves.\n     [6] Then the Philistines said, “Who has done this?”\n    They said, “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife and given her to his companion.” The Philistines came up, and burned her and her father with fire.\n     [7] Samson said to them, “If you behave like this, surely I will take revenge on you, and after that I will cease.”  [8] He struck them hip and thigh with a great slaughter; and he went down and lived in the cave in Etam’s rock.  [9] Then the Philistines went up, encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.\n     [10] The men of Judah said, “Why have you come up against us?”\n    They said, “We have come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he has done to us.”\n     [11] Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cave in Etam’s rock, and said to Samson, “Don’t you know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us?”\n    He said to them, “As they did to me, so I have done to them.”\n     [12] They said to him, “We have come down to bind you, that we may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines.”\n    Samson said to them, “Swear to me that you will not attack me yourselves.”\n     [13] They spoke to him, saying, “No, but we will bind you securely and deliver you into their hands; but surely we will not kill you.” They bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock.\n     [14] When He came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met Him. Then Yahweh’s Spirit came mightily on Him, and the ropes that were on His arms became as flax that was burned with fire; and His bands dropped from off His hands.  [15] He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, put out his hand, took it, and struck a thousand men with it.  [16] Samson said, “With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps on heaps; with the jawbone of a donkey I have struck a thousand men.”  [17] When he had finished speaking, he threw the jawbone out of his hand; and that place was called Ramath Lehi.\n     [18] He was very thirsty, and called on Yahweh and said, “You have given this great deliverance by the hand of your servant; and now shall I die of thirst, and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?”\n     [19] But God split the hollow place that is in Lehi, and water came out of it. When He had drunk, His spirit came again, and He revived. Therefore its name was called En Hakkore, which is in Lehi, to this day.

[2] The Gazites were told, “Samson is here!” They surrounded him and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, “Wait until morning light; then we will kill him.”  [3] Samson lay until midnight, then arose at midnight and took hold of the doors of the gate of the city, with the two posts, and plucked them up, bar and all, and put them on his shoulders and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is before Hebron.\n     [4] It came to pass afterward that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.  [5] The lords of the Philistines came up to her and said to her, “Entice him, and see in which his great strength lies, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and we will each give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.”\n     [6] Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell me where your great strength lies, and what you might be bound to afflict you.”\n     [7] Samson said to her, “If they bind me with seven green cords that were never dried, then shall I become weak, and be as another man.”\n     [8] Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green cords which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.  [9] Now she had an ambush waiting in the inner room. She said to him, “The Philistines are on you, Samson!” He broke the cords as a flax thread is broken when it touches the fire. So his strength was not known.\n     [10] Delilah said to Samson, “Behold, you have mocked me, and told me lies. Now please tell me how you might be bound.”\n     [11] He said to her, “If they only bind me with new ropes with which no work has been done, then shall I become weak, and be as another man.”\n     [12] So Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them, then said to him, “The Philistines are on you, Samson!” The ambush was waiting in the inner room. He broke them off his arms like a thread.\n     [13] Delilah said to Samson, “Until now, you have mocked me and told me lies. Tell me with what you might be bound.”\n    He said to her, “If you weave the seven locks of my head with the fabric on the loom.”\n     [14] She fastened it with the pin, and said to him, “The Philistines are on you, Samson!” He awakened out of his sleep, and plucked away the pin of the beam and the fabric.\n     [15] She said to him, “How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me these three times, and have not told me where your great strength lies.”\n     [16] When she pressed him daily with her words and urged him, his soul was troubled to death.  [17] He told her all His heart and said to her, “No razor has ever come on my head; for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother’s womb. If I am shaved, then my strength will go from me and I will become weak, and be like any other man.”\n     [18] When Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, “Come up this once, for he has told me all his heart.” Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her and brought the money in their hand.  [19] She made him sleep on her knees; and she called for a man and shaved off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.  [20] She said, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!”\n    He awoke out of His sleep, and said, “I will go out as at other times, and shake myself free.” But He didn’t know that Yahweh had departed from Him.  [21] The Philistines laid hold on him and put out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza and bound him with fetters of bronze; and he ground at the mill in the prison.  [22] However, the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaved.\n     [23] The lords of the Philistines gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice; for they said, “Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.”  [24] When the people saw Him, they praised their god; for they said, “Our god has delivered our enemy and the destroyer of our country, who has slain many of us, into our hand.”\n     [25] When their hearts were merry, they said, “Call for Samson, that he may entertain us.” They called for Samson out of the prison; and he performed before them. They set him between the pillars;  [26] and Samson said to the boy who held him by the hand, “Allow me to feel the pillars on which the house rests, that I may lean on them.”  [27] Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were on the roof about three thousand men and women, who saw while Samson performed.  [28] Samson called to Yahweh, and said, “Lord Yahweh, remember me, please, and strengthen me, please, only this once, God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.”  [29] Samson took hold of the two middle pillars on which the house rested and leaned on them, the one with his right hand and the other with his left.  [30] Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” He bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell on the lords, and on all the people who were in it. So the dead that he killed at his death were more than those who he killed in his life.\n     [31] Then his brothers and all the house of his father came down and took him, and brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burial site of Manoah his father. He judged Israel twenty years.\n"

I took it.”\n    His mother said, “May Yahweh bless my son!”\n     [3] He restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to His mother, then His mother said, “I most certainly dedicate the silver to Yahweh from my hand for my son, to make a carved image and a molten image.

In those days the tribe of the Danites sought an inheritance to dwell in; for to that day, their inheritance had not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel.  [2] The children of Dan sent five men of their family from their whole number, men of valor, from Zorah and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land and to search it. They said to them, “Go, explore the land!”\n    They came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there.  [3] When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite; so they went over there and said to him, “Who brought you here? What do you do in this place? What do you have here?”\n     [4] He said to them, “Thus and thus has Micah dealt with me, and he has hired me, and I have become his priest.”\n     [5] They said to Him, “Please ask counsel of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.”\n     [6] The priest said to them, “Go in peace. Your way in which you go is before Yahweh.”\n     [7] Then the five men departed and came to Laish and saw the people who were there, how they lived in safety, in the way of the Sidonians, quiet and secure; for there was no one in the land possessing authority, that might put them to shame in anything, and they were far from the Sidonians, and had no dealings with anyone else.  [8] They came to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol; and their brothers asked them, “What do you say?”\n     [9] They said, “Arise, and let’s go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good. Do you stand still? Don’t be slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land.  [10] When you go, you will come to an unsuspecting people, and the land is large; for God has given it into your hand, a place where there is no lack of anything that is in the earth.”\n     [11] The family of the Danites set out from Zorah and Eshtaol with six hundred men armed with weapons of war.  [12] They went up and encamped in Kiriath Jearim in Judah. Therefore they call that place Mahaneh Dan to this day. Behold, it is behind Kiriath Jearim.  [13] They passed from there to the hill country of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.\n     [14] Then the five men who went to spy out the country of Laish answered and said to their brothers, “Do you know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a carved image, and a molten image? Now therefore consider what you have to do.”  [15] They went over there and came to the house of the young Levite man, even to the house of Micah, and asked him how he was doing.  [16] The six hundred men armed with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.  [17] The five men who went to spy out the land went up, and came in there, and took the engraved image, the ephod, the teraphim, and the molten image; and the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men armed with weapons of war.\n     [18] When these went into Micah’s house, and took the engraved image, the ephod, the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?”\n     [19] They said to him, “Hold your peace, put your hand on your mouth, and go with us. Be a father and a priest to us. Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?”\n     [20] The priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, the teraphim, and the engraved image, and went with the people.  [21] So they turned and departed, and put the little ones, the livestock, and the goods before them.  [22] When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men who were in the houses near Micah’s house gathered together and overtook the children of Dan.  [23] As they called to the children of Dan, they turned their faces, and said to Micah, “What ails you, that you come with such a company?”\n     [24] He said, “You have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and have gone away! What more do I have? How can you ask me, ‘What ails you?’”\n     [25] The children of Dan said to him, “Don’t let your voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall on you, and you lose your life, with the lives of your household.”\n     [26] The children of Dan went their way; and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.  [27] They took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and unsuspecting, and struck them with the edge of the sword; then they burned the city with fire.  [28] There was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with anyone else; and it was in the valley that lies by Beth Rehob. They built the city and lived in it.  [29] They called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel; however the name of the city used to be Laish.  [30] The children of Dan set up for themselves the engraved image; and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land.  [31] So they set up for themselves Micah’s engraved image which He made, and it remained all the time that God’s house was in Shiloh.\n"

So they ate and drank, and stayed there.\n     [5] On the fourth day, they got up early in the morning, and he rose up to depart. The young lady’s father said to his son-in-law, “Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward you shall go your way.”  [6] So they sat down, ate, and drank, both of them together. Then the young lady’s father said to the man, “Please be pleased to stay all night, and let your heart be merry.”  [7] The man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law urged him, and he stayed there again.  [8] He arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the young lady’s father said, “Please strengthen your heart and stay until the day declines;” and they both ate.\n     [9] When the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the young lady’s father, said to him, “Behold, now the day draws toward evening, please stay all night. Behold, the day is ending. Stay here, that your heart may be merry; and tomorrow go on your way early, that you may go home.”  [10] But the man wouldn’t stay that night, but he rose up and went near Jebus (also called Jerusalem). With him were a couple of saddled donkeys. His concubine also was with him.\n     [11] When they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, “Please come and let’s enter into this city of the Jebusites, and stay in it.”\n     [12] His master said to him, “We won’t enter into the city of a foreigner that is not of the children of Israel; but we will pass over to Gibeah.”  [13] He said to his servant, “Come and let’s draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.”  [14] So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down on them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.  [15] They went over there, to go in to stay in Gibeah. He went in, and sat down in the street of the city; for there was no one who took them into his house to stay.\n     [16] Behold, an old man came from his work out of the field at evening. Now the man was from the hill country of Ephraim, and he lived in Gibeah; but the men of the place were Benjamites.  [17] He lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city; and the old man said, “Where are you going? Where did you come from?”\n     [18] He said to Him, “We are passing from Bethlehem Judah to the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim. I am from there, and I went to Bethlehem Judah. I am going to Yahweh’s house; and there is no one who has taken me into His house.  [19] Yet there is both straw and feed for our donkeys; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for your servant, and for the young man who is with your servants. There is no lack of anything.”\n     [20] The old man said, “Peace be to you! Just let me supply all your needs, but don’t sleep in the street.”  [21] So he brought him into his house, and gave the donkeys fodder. Then they washed their feet, and ate and drank.  [22] As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain wicked fellows, surrounded the house, beating at the door; and they spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, “Bring out the man who came into your house, that we can have sex with him!”\n     [23] The man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, “No, my brothers, please don’t act so wickedly; since this man has come into my house, don’t do this folly.  [24] Behold, here is my virgin daughter and his concubine. I will bring them out now. Humble them, and do with them what seems good to you; but to this man don’t do any such folly.”\n     [25] But the men wouldn’t listen to him; so the man grabbed his concubine, and brought her out to them; and they had sex with her, and abused her all night until the morning. When the day began to dawn, they let her go.  [26] Then the woman came in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man’s house where her lord was, until it was light.  [27] Her lord rose up in the morning and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and behold, the woman his concubine had fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands on the threshold.\n     [28] He said to her, “Get up, and let’s get going!” but no one answered. Then he took her up on the donkey; and the man rose up, and went to his place.\n     [29] When he had come into his house, he took a knife and cut up his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel.  [30] It was so, that all who saw it said, “Such a deed has not been done or seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt to this day! Consider it, take counsel, and speak.”\n"

[2] The chiefs of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen who drew sword.  [3] (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) The children of Israel said, “Tell us, how did this wickedness happen?”\n     [4] The Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered, “I came into Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to spend the night.  [5] The men of Gibeah rose against me, and surrounded the house by night. They intended to kill me and they raped my concubine, and she is dead.  [6] I took my concubine and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel; for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.  [7] Behold, you children of Israel, all of you, give here your advice and counsel.”\n     [8] All the people arose as one man, saying, “None of us will go to his tent, neither will any of us turn to his house.  [9] But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against it by lot;  [10] and we will take ten men of one hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and one hundred of one thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand to get food for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that the men of Gibeah have done in Israel.”  [11] So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.\n     [12] The tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What wickedness is this that has happened among you?  [13] Now therefore deliver up the men, the wicked fellows who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death and put away evil from Israel.”\n    But Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers, the children of Israel.  [14] The children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.  [15] The children of Benjamin were counted on that day out of the cities twenty-six thousand men who drew the sword, in addition to the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were counted seven hundred chosen men.  [16] Among all these soldiers there were seven hundred chosen men who were left-handed. Every one of them could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.  [17] The men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were counted four hundred thousand men who drew sword. All these were men of war.\n     [18] The children of Israel arose, went up to Bethel, and asked counsel of God. They asked, “Who shall go up for us first to battle against the children of Benjamin?”\n    Yahweh said, “Judah first.”\n     [19] The children of Israel rose up in the morning and encamped against Gibeah.  [20] The men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah.  [21] The children of Benjamin came out of Gibeah, and on that day destroyed twenty-two thousand of the Israelite men down to the ground.  [22] The people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves, and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day.  [23] The children of Israel went up and wept before Yahweh until evening; and they asked of Yahweh, saying, “Shall I again draw near to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother?”\n    Yahweh said, “Go up against Him.”\n     [24] The children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.  [25] Benjamin went out against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men. All these drew the sword.\n     [26] Then all the children of Israel and all the people went up, and came to Bethel, and wept, and sat there before Yahweh, and fasted that day until evening; then they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh.  [27] The children of Israel asked Yahweh (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,  [28] and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, “Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease?”\n    Yahweh said, “Go up; for tomorrow I will deliver Him into your hand.”\n     [29] Israel set ambushes all around Gibeah.  [30] The children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.  [31] The children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to strike and kill of the people as at other times, in the highways, of which one goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah, in the field, about thirty men of Israel.\n     [32] The children of Benjamin said, “They are struck down before us, as at the first.” But the children of Israel said, “Let’s flee, and draw them away from the city to the highways.”\n     [33] All the men of Israel rose up out of their place and set themselves in array at Baal Tamar. Then the ambushers of Israel broke out of their place, even out of Maareh Geba.  [34] Ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel came over against Gibeah, and the battle was severe; but they didn’t know that disaster was close to them.  [35] Yahweh struck Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty-five thousand one hundred men. All these drew the sword.  [36] So the children of Benjamin saw that they were struck, for the men of Israel yielded to Benjamin because they trusted the ambushers whom they had set against Gibeah.  [37] The ambushers hurried, and rushed on Gibeah; then the ambushers spread out, and struck all the city with the edge of the sword.  [38] Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the ambushers was that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city.  [39] The men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to strike and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons; for they said, “Surely they are struck down before us, as in the first battle.”  [40] But when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them; and behold, the whole city went up in smoke to the sky.  [41] The men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed; for they saw that disaster had come on them.  [42] Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness, but the battle followed hard after them; and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in the middle of it.  [43] They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them, and trod them down at their resting place, as far as near Gibeah toward the sunrise.  [44] Eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell; all these were men of valor.  [45] They turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon. They gleaned five thousand men of them in the highways, and followed hard after them to Gidom, and struck two thousand men of them.  [46] So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword. All these were men of valor.  [47] But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and stayed in the rock of Rimmon four months.  [48] The men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin, and struck them with the edge of the sword—including the entire city, the livestock, and all that they found. Moreover they set all the cities which they found on fire.\n"

[3] They said, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, why has this happened in Israel, that there should be one tribe lacking in Israel today?”\n     [4] On the next day, the people rose early and built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.  [5] The children of Israel said, “Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who didn’t come up in the assembly to Yahweh?” For they had made a great oath concerning Him who didn’t come up to Yahweh to Mizpah, saying, “He shall surely be put to death.”  [6] The children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother, and said, “There is one tribe cut off from Israel today.  [7] How shall we provide wives for those who remain, since we have sworn by Yahweh that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?”  [8] They said, “What one is there of the tribes of Israel who didn’t come up to Yahweh to Mizpah?” Behold, no one came from Jabesh Gilead to the camp to the assembly.  [9] For when the people were counted, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead there.  [10] The congregation sent twelve thousand of the most valiant men there, and commanded them, saying, “Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones.  [11] This is the thing that you shall do: you shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman who has lain with a man.”  [12] They found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins who had not known man by lying with him; and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.\n     [13] The whole congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin who were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace to them.  [14] Benjamin returned at that time; and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh Gilead. There still weren’t enough for them.  [15] The people grieved for Benjamin, because Yahweh had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.  [16] Then the elders of the congregation said, “How shall we provide wives for those who remain, since the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?”  [17] They said, “There must be an inheritance for those who are escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe not be blotted out from Israel.  [18] However, we may not give them wives of our daughters, for the children of Israel had sworn, saying, ‘Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin.’”  [19] They said, “Behold, there is a feast of Yahweh from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.”  [20] They commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, “Go and lie in wait in the vineyards,  [21] and see, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come out of the vineyards, and each man catch his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.  [22] It shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, that we will say to them, ‘Grant them graciously to us, because we didn’t take for each man his wife in battle, neither did you give them to them; otherwise you would now be guilty.’”\n     [23] The children of Benjamin did so, and took wives for themselves according to their number, of those who danced, whom they carried off. They went and returned to their inheritance, built the cities, and lived in them.  [24] The children of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they each went out from there to his own inheritance.  [25] In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did that which was right in his own eyes.\n"

A certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to live in the country of Moab with his wife and his two sons.  [2] The name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi. The names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem Judah. They came into the country of Moab and lived there.  [3] Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died; and she was left with her two sons.  [4] They took for themselves wives of the women of Moab. The name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other was Ruth. They lived there about ten years.  [5] Mahlon and Chilion both died, and the woman was bereaved of her two children and of her husband.  [6] Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab; for she had heard in the country of Moab how Yahweh had visited His people in giving them bread.  [7] She went out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her. They went on the way to return to the land of Judah.  [8] Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go, return each of you to her mother’s house. May Yahweh deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me.  [9] May Yahweh grant you that you may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband.”\n    Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices, and wept.  [10] They said to her, “No, but we will return with you to your people.”\n     [11] Naomi said, “Go back, my daughters. Why do you want to go with me? Do I still have sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?  [12] Go back, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say, ‘I have hope,’ if I should even have a husband tonight, and should also bear sons,  [13] would you then wait until they were grown? Would you then refrain from having husbands? No, my daughters, for it grieves me seriously for your sakes, for Yahweh’s hand has gone out against me.”\n     [14] They lifted up their voices and wept again; then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth stayed with her.  [15] She said, “Behold, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her god. Follow your sister-in-law.”\n     [16] Ruth said, “Don’t urge me to leave you, and to return from following you, for where you go, I will go; and where you stay, I will stay. Your people will be my people, and your God my God.  [17] Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May Yahweh do so to me, and more also, if anything but death parts you and me.”\n     [18] When Naomi saw that she was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her.\n     [19] So they both went until they came to Bethlehem. When they had come to Bethlehem, all the city was excited about them, and they asked, “Is this Naomi?”\n     [20] She said to them, “Don’t call me Naomi. Call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.  [21] I went out full, and Yahweh has brought me home again empty. Why do you call me Naomi, since Yahweh has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?”  [22] So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the country of Moab. They came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.\n"

[2] Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, “Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I find favor.”\n    She said to her, “Go, my daughter.”  [3] She went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.\n     [4] Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, “May Yahweh be with you.”\n    They answered Him, “May Yahweh bless you.”\n     [5] Then Boaz said to his servant who was set over the reapers, “Whose young lady is this?”\n     [6] The servant who was set over the reapers answered, “It is the Moabite lady who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab.  [7] She said, ‘Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.’ So she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, except that she rested a little in the house.”\n     [8] Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen, my daughter. Don’t go to glean in another field, and don’t go from here, but stay here close to my maidens.  [9] Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them. Haven’t I commanded the young men not to touch you? When you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink from that which the young men have drawn.”\n     [10] Then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should take knowledge of me, since I am a foreigner?”\n     [11] Boaz answered her, “I have been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you have left your father, your mother, and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you didn’t know before.  [12] May Yahweh repay your work, and a full reward be given to you from Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.”\n     [13] Then she said, “Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, because you have comforted me, and because you have spoken kindly to your servant, though I am not as one of your servants.”\n     [14] At meal time Boaz said to her, “Come here, and eat some bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar.”\n    She sat beside the reapers, and they passed her parched grain. She ate, was satisfied, and left some of it.  [15] When she had risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, “Let her glean even among the sheaves, and don’t reproach her.  [16] Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it. Let her glean, and don’t rebuke her.”\n     [17] So she gleaned in the field until evening; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.  [18] She took it up, and went into the city. Then her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned; and she brought out and gave to her that which she had left after she had enough.\n     [19] Her mother-in-law said to her, “Where have you gleaned today? Where have you worked? Blessed be he who noticed you.”\n    She told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, “The man’s name with whom I worked today is Boaz.”  [20] Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May He be blessed by Yahweh, who has not abandoned His kindness to the living and to the dead.” Naomi said to her, “The man is a close relative to us, one of our near kinsmen.”\n     [21] Ruth the Moabitess said, “Yes, he said to me, ‘You shall stay close to my young men until they have finished all my harvest.’”\n     [22] Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, “It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, and that they not meet you in any other field.”  [23] So she stayed close to the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she lived with her mother-in-law.\n"

Take my right of redemption for yourself; for I can’t redeem it.”\n     [7] Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man took off his sandal, and gave it to his neighbor; and this was the way of formalizing transactions in Israel.  [8] So the near kinsman said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself,” then he took off his sandal.\n     [9] Boaz said to the elders and to all the people, “You are witnesses today, that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s, and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, from the hand of Naomi.  [10] Moreover, Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, I have purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brothers and from the gate of his place. You are witnesses today.”\n     [11] All the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, “We are witnesses. May Yahweh make the woman who has come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, which both built the house of Israel; and treat you worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Bethlehem.  [12] Let your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the offspring which Yahweh will give you by this young woman.”\n     [13] So Boaz took Ruth and she became His wife; and He went in to her, and Yahweh enabled her to conceive, and she bore a son.  [14] The women said to Naomi, “Blessed be Yahweh, who has not left you today without a near kinsman. Let His name be famous in Israel.  [15] He shall be to you a restorer of life and sustain you in your old age; for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has given birth to him.”  [16] Naomi took the child, laid him in her bosom, and became nurse to him.  [17] The women, her neighbors, gave him a name, saying, “A son is born to Naomi”. They named him Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David.\n     [18] Now this is the history of the generations of Perez: Perez became the father of Hezron,  [19] and Hezron became the father of Ram, and Ram became the father of Amminadab,  [20] and Amminadab became the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon became the father of Salmon,  [21] and Salmon became the father of Boaz, and Boaz became the father of Obed,  [22] and Obed became the father of Jesse, and Jesse became the father of David.\n"

          "content": "     [1] Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim, of the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.  [2] He had two wives. The name of one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.  [3] This man went up out of His city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to Yahweh of Armies in Shiloh. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to Yahweh, were there.  [4] When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters;  [5] but He gave a double portion to Hannah, for He loved Hannah, but Yahweh had shut up her womb.  [6] Her rival provoked her severely, to irritate her, because Yahweh had shut up her womb.  [7] So year by year, when she went up to Yahweh’s house, her rival provoked her. Therefore she wept, and didn’t eat.  [8] Elkanah her husband said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep? Why don’t you eat? Why is your heart grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”\n     [9] So Hannah rose up after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on His seat by the doorpost of Yahweh’s temple.  [10] She was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to Yahweh, weeping bitterly.  [11] She vowed a vow, and said, “Yahweh of Armies, if you will indeed look at the affliction of your servant and remember me, and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a boy, then I will give Him to Yahweh all the days of His life, and no razor shall come on His head.”\n     [12] As she continued praying before Yahweh, Eli saw her mouth.  [13] Now Hannah spoke in her heart. Only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she was drunk.  [14] Eli said to her, “How long will you be drunk? Get rid of your wine!”\n     [15] Hannah answered, “No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have not been drinking wine or strong drink, but I poured out my soul before Yahweh.  [16] Don’t consider your servant a wicked woman; for I have been speaking out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation.”\n     [17] Then Eli answered, “Go in peace; and may the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of Him.”\n     [18] She said, “Let your servant find favor in your sight.” So the woman went her way and ate; and her facial expression wasn’t sad any more.\n     [19] They rose up in the morning early and worshiped Yahweh, then returned and came to their house to Ramah. Then Elkanah knew Hannah His wife; and Yahweh remembered her.\n     [20] When the time had come, Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she named Him Samuel, saying, “Because I have asked Him of Yahweh.”\n     [21] The man Elkanah, and all His house, went up to offer to Yahweh the yearly sacrifice and His vow.  [22] But Hannah didn’t go up, for she said to her husband, “Not until the child is weaned; then I will bring Him, that He may appear before Yahweh, and stay there forever.”\n     [23] Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what seems good to you. Wait until you have weaned Him; only may Yahweh establish His word.”\n    So the woman waited and nursed her son until she weaned Him.  [24] When she had weaned Him, she took Him up with her, with three bulls, and one ephah of meal, and a container of wine, and brought Him to Yahweh’s house in Shiloh. The child was young.  [25] They killed the bull, and brought the child to Eli.  [26] She said, “Oh, my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood by you here, praying to Yahweh.  [27] I prayed for this child, and Yahweh has given me my petition which I asked of Him.  [28] Therefore I have also given Him to Yahweh. As long as He lives He is given to Yahweh.” He worshiped Yahweh there.\n"

The child served Yahweh before Eli the priest.\n     [12] Now the sons of Eli were wicked men. They didn’t know Yahweh.  [13] The custom of the priests with the people was that when anyone offered a sacrifice, the priest’s servant came while the meat was boiling, with a fork of three teeth in his hand;  [14] and he stabbed it into the pan, or kettle, or cauldron, or pot. The priest took all that the fork brought up for himself. They did this to all the Israelites who came there to Shiloh.  [15] Yes, before they burned the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man who sacrificed, “Give meat to roast for the priest; for he will not accept boiled meat from you, but raw.”\n     [16] If the man said to him, “Let the fat be burned first, and then take as much as your soul desires;” then he would say, “No, but you shall give it to me now; and if not, I will take it by force.”  [17] The sin of the young men was very great before Yahweh; for the men despised Yahweh’s offering.  [18] But Samuel ministered before Yahweh, being a child, clothed with a linen ephod.  [19] Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.  [20] Eli blessed Elkanah and His wife, and said, “May Yahweh give you offspring from this woman for the petition which was asked of Yahweh.” Then they went to their own home.  [21] Yahweh visited Hannah, and she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. The child Samuel grew before Yahweh.\n     [22] Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how that they slept with the women who served at the door of the Tent of Meeting.  [23] He said to them, “Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all these people.  [24] No, my sons; for it is not a good report that I hear! You make Yahweh’s people disobey.  [25] If one man sins against another, God will judge Him; but if a man sins against Yahweh, who will intercede for Him?” Notwithstanding, they didn’t listen to the voice of their father, because Yahweh intended to kill them.\n     [26] The child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Yahweh and also with men.\n     [27] A man of God came to Eli and said to Him, “Yahweh says, ‘Did I reveal myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh’s house?  [28] Didn’t I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? Didn’t I give to the house of your father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?  [29] Why do you kick at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation, and honor your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel my people?’  [30] “Therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘I said indeed that your house and the house of your father should walk before me forever.’ But now Yahweh says, ‘Far be it from me; for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me will be cursed.  [31] Behold, the days come that I will cut off your arm and the arm of your father’s house, that there will not be an old man in your house.  [32] You will see the affliction of my habitation, in all the wealth which I will give Israel. There shall not be an old man in your house forever.  [33] The man of yours whom I don’t cut off from my altar will consume your eyes and grieve your heart. All the increase of your house will die in the flower of their age.  [34] This will be the sign to you that will come on your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they will both die.  [35] I will raise up a faithful priest for myself who will do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind. I will build him a sure house. He will walk before my anointed forever.  [36] It will happen that everyone who is left in your house will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and will say, “Please put me into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.”’”\n"

[2] At that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see),  [3] and God’s lamp hadn’t yet gone out, and Samuel had laid down in Yahweh’s temple where God’s ark was,  [4] Yahweh called Samuel. He said, “Here I am.”\n     [5] He ran to Eli and said, “Here I am; for you called me.”\n    He said, “I didn’t call. Lie down again.”\n    He went and lay down.  [6] Yahweh called yet again, “Samuel!”\n    Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, “Here I am; for you called me.”\n    He answered, “I didn’t call, my son. Lie down again.”  [7] Now Samuel didn’t yet know Yahweh, neither was Yahweh’s word yet revealed to Him.  [8] Yahweh called Samuel again the third time. He arose and went to Eli and said, “Here I am; for you called me.”\n    Eli perceived that Yahweh had called the child.  [9] Therefore Eli said to Samuel, “Go, lie down. It shall be, if He calls you, that you shall say, ‘Speak, Yahweh; for your servant hears.’” So Samuel went and lay down in His place.  [10] Yahweh came, and stood, and called as at other times, “Samuel! Samuel!”\n    Then Samuel said, “Speak; for your servant hears.”\n     [11] Yahweh said to Samuel, “Behold, I will do a thing in Israel at which both the ears of everyone who hears it will tingle.  [12] In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even to the end.  [13] For I have told him that I will judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons brought a curse on themselves, and he didn’t restrain them.  [14] Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be removed with sacrifice or offering forever.”\n     [15] Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of Yahweh’s house. Samuel was afraid to show Eli the vision.  [16] Then Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son!”\n    He said, “Here I am.”\n     [17] He said, “What is the thing that He has spoken to you? Please don’t hide it from me. God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the things that He spoke to you.”\n     [18] Samuel told Him every bit, and hid nothing from Him.\n    He said, “It is Yahweh. Let Him do what seems good to Him.”\n     [19] Samuel grew, and Yahweh was with Him and let none of His words fall to the ground.  [20] All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Yahweh.  [21] Yahweh appeared again in Shiloh; for Yahweh revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh by Yahweh’s word.\n"

[2] The Philistines put themselves in array against Israel. When they joined battle, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men of the army in the field.  [3] When the people had come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has Yahweh defeated us today before the Philistines? Let’s get the ark of Yahweh’s covenant out of Shiloh and bring it to us, that it may come among us and save us out of the hand of our enemies.”\n     [4] So the people sent to Shiloh, and they brought from there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh of Armies, who sits above the cherubim; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.  [5] When the ark of Yahweh’s covenant came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth resounded.  [6] When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, “What does the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews mean?” They understood that Yahweh’s ark had come into the camp.  [7] The Philistines were afraid, for they said, “God has come into the camp.” They said, “Woe to us! For there has not been such a thing before.  [8] Woe to us! Who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods that struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness.  [9] Be strong and behave like men, O you Philistines, that you not be servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Strengthen yourselves like men, and fight!”  [10] The Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and each man fled to his tent. There was a very great slaughter; for thirty thousand footmen of Israel fell.  [11] God’s ark was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.\n     [12] A man of Benjamin ran out of the army and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes torn and with dirt on his head.  [13] When He came, behold, Eli was sitting on His seat by the road watching, for His heart trembled for God’s ark. When the man came into the city and told about it, all the city cried out.  [14] When Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, “What does the noise of this tumult mean?”\n    The man hurried, and came and told Eli.  [15] Now Eli was ninety-eight years old. His eyes were set, so that he could not see.  [16] The man said to Eli, “I am he who came out of the army, and I fled today out of the army.”\n    He said, “How did the matter go, my son?”\n     [17] He who brought the news answered, “Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the people. Your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and God’s ark has been captured.”\n     [18] When He made mention of God’s ark, Eli fell from off His seat backward by the side of the gate; and His neck broke, and He died, for He was an old man and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years.\n     [19] His daughter-in-law, Phinehas’ wife, was with child, near to giving birth. When she heard the news that God’s ark was taken and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and gave birth; for her pains came on her.  [20] About the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her, “Don’t be afraid, for you have given birth to a son.” But she didn’t answer, neither did she regard it.  [21] She named the child Ichabod, saying, “The glory has departed from Israel!” because God’s ark was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.  [22] She said, “The glory has departed from Israel; for God’s ark has been taken.”\n"

Then you will be healed, and it will be known to you why His hand is not removed from you.”\n     [4] Then they said, “What should the trespass offering be which we shall return to him?”\n    They said, “Five golden tumors and five golden mice, for the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.

It was a chance that happened to us.”\n     [10] The men did so, and took two milk cows and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home.  [11] They put Yahweh’s ark on the cart, and the box with the golden mice and the images of their tumors.  [12] The cows took the straight way by the way to Beth Shemesh. They went along the highway, lowing as they went, and didn’t turn away to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them to the border of Beth Shemesh.

[14] The cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and stood there, where there was a great stone. Then they split the wood of the cart and offered up the cows for a burnt offering to Yahweh.  [15] The Levites took down Yahweh’s ark and the box that was with it, in which the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone; and the men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day to Yahweh.  [16] When the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.  [17] These are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering to Yahweh: for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;  [18] and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified cities and of country villages, even to the great stone on which they set down Yahweh’s ark. That stone remains to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh.  [19] He struck of the men of Beth Shemesh, because they had looked into Yahweh’s ark, He struck fifty thousand seventy of the men. Then the people mourned, because Yahweh had struck the people with a great slaughter.  [20] The men of Beth Shemesh said, “Who is able to stand before Yahweh, this holy God? To whom shall He go up from us?”\n     [21] They sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath Jearim, saying, “The Philistines have brought back Yahweh’s ark.

[10] As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines came near to battle against Israel; but Yahweh thundered with a great thunder on that day on the Philistines and confused them; and they were struck down before Israel.  [11] The men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and struck them until they came under Beth Kar.\n     [12] Then Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called its name Ebenezer, saying, “Yahweh helped us until now.”  [13] So the Philistines were subdued, and they stopped coming within the border of Israel. Yahweh’s hand was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.\n     [14] The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and Israel recovered its border out of the hand of the Philistines. There was peace between Israel and the Amorites.\n     [15] Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.  [16] He went from year to year in a circuit to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all those places.  [17] His return was to Ramah, for His house was there, and He judged Israel there; and He built an altar to Yahweh there.\n"

They were judges in Beersheba.  [3] His sons didn’t walk in his ways, but turned away after dishonest gain, took bribes, and perverted justice.\n     [4] Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together and came to Samuel to Ramah.  [5] They said to him, “Behold, you are old, and your sons don’t walk in your ways. Now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.”  [6] But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, “Give us a king to judge us.”\n    Samuel prayed to Yahweh.  [7] Yahweh said to Samuel, “Listen to the voice of the people in all that they tell you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me as the king over them.  [8] According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day, in that they have forsaken me and served other gods, so they also do to you.  [9] Now therefore, listen to their voice. However, you shall protest solemnly to them, and shall show them the way of the king who will reign over them.”\n     [10] Samuel told all Yahweh’s words to the people who asked Him for a king.  [11] He said, “This will be the way of the king who shall reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them as his servants, for his chariots and to be his horsemen; and they will run before his chariots.  [12] He will appoint them to him for captains of thousands and captains of fifties; and he will assign some to plow his ground and to reap his harvest; and to make his instruments of war and the instruments of his chariots.  [13] He will take your daughters to be perfumers, to be cooks, and to be bakers.  [14] He will take your fields, your vineyards, and your olive groves, even your best, and give them to his servants.  [15] He will take one tenth of your seed and of your vineyards, and give it to his officers and to his servants.  [16] He will take your male servants, your female servants, your best young men, and your donkeys, and assign them to his own work.  [17] He will take one tenth of your flocks; and you will be his servants.  [18] You will cry out in that day because of your king whom you will have chosen for yourselves; and Yahweh will not answer you in that day.”\n     [19] But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel; and they said, “No, but we will have a king over us,  [20] that we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.”\n     [21] Samuel heard all the words of the people, and He rehearsed them in the ears of Yahweh.  [22] Yahweh said to Samuel, “Listen to their voice, and make them a king.”\n    Samuel said to the men of Israel, “Everyone go to your own city.”\n"

[2] He had a son whose name was Saul, an impressive young man; and there was not among the children of Israel a more handsome person than he. From his shoulders and upward he was taller than any of the people.\n     [3] The donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, were lost. Kish said to Saul his son, “Now take one of the servants with you, and arise, go look for the donkeys.”  [4] He passed through the hill country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they didn’t find them. Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and they weren’t there. Then he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they didn’t find them.\n     [5] When they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, “Come! Let’s return, lest my father stop caring about the donkeys and be anxious for us.”\n     [6] The servant said to Him, “Behold now, there is a man of God in this city, and He is a man who is held in honor. All that He says surely happens. Now let’s go there. Perhaps He can tell us which way to go.”\n     [7] Then Saul said to His servant, “But behold, if we go, what should we bring the man? For the bread is spent in our sacks, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God. What do we have?”\n     [8] The servant answered Saul again and said, “Behold, I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver. I will give that to the man of God, to tell us our way.”  [9] (In earlier times in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, He said, “Come! Let’s go to the seer;” for He who is now called a prophet was before called a seer.)\n     [10] Then Saul said to His servant, “Well said. Come! Let’s go.” So they went to the city where the man of God was.  [11] As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said to them, “Is the seer here?”\n     [12] They answered them and said, “He is. Behold, he is before you. Hurry now, for he has come today into the city; for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place.  [13] As soon as you have come into the city, you will immediately find him before he goes up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he comes, because he blesses the sacrifice. Afterwards those who are invited eat. Now therefore go up; for at this time you will find him.”\n     [14] They went up to the city. As they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them to go up to the high place.\n     [15] Now Yahweh had revealed to Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,  [16] “Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man out of the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over my people Israel. He will save my people out of the hand of the Philistines; for I have looked upon my people, because their cry has come to me.”\n     [17] When Samuel saw Saul, Yahweh said to Him, “Behold, the man of whom I spoke to you! He will have authority over my people.”\n     [18] Then Saul approached Samuel in the gateway, and said, “Please tell me where the seer’s house is.”\n     [19] Samuel answered Saul and said, “I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for you are to eat with me today. In the morning I will let you go and will tell you all that is in your heart.  [20] As for your donkeys who were lost three days ago, don’t set your mind on them, for they have been found. For whom does all Israel desire? Is it not you and all your father’s house?”\n     [21] Saul answered, “Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? And my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then do you speak to me like this?”\n     [22] Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the guest room, and made them sit in the best place among those who were invited, who were about thirty persons.  [23] Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said to you, ‘Set it aside.’”  [24] The cook took up the thigh, and that which was on it, and set it before Saul. Samuel said, “Behold, that which has been reserved! Set it before yourself and eat; because it has been kept for you for the appointed time, for I said, ‘I have invited the people.’” So Saul ate with Samuel that day.\n     [25] When they had come down from the high place into the city, he talked with Saul on the housetop.  [26] They arose early; and about daybreak, Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, “Get up, that I may send you away.” Saul arose, and they both went outside, he and Samuel, together.  [27] As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to go on ahead of us.” He went ahead, then Samuel said, “But stand still first, that I may cause you to hear God’s message.”\n"

[2] When you have departed from me today, then you will find two men by Rachel’s tomb, on the border of Benjamin at Zelzah. They will tell you, ‘The donkeys which you went to look for have been found; and behold, your father has stopped caring about the donkeys and is anxious for you, saying, “What shall I do for my son?”’\n     [3] “Then you will go on forward from there, and you will come to the oak of Tabor. Three men will meet you there going up to God to Bethel: one carrying three young goats, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a container of wine.  [4] They will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall receive from their hand.\n     [5] “After that you will come to the hill of God, where the garrison of the Philistines is; and it will happen, when you have come there to the city, that you will meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a lute, a tambourine, a pipe, and a harp before them; and they will be prophesying.  [6] Then Yahweh’s Spirit will come mightily on you, then you will prophesy with them and will be turned into another man.  [7] Let it be, when these signs have come to you, that you do what is appropriate for the occasion; for God is with you.\n     [8] “Go down ahead of me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings. Wait seven days, until I come to you and show you what you are to do.”  [9] It was so, that when He had turned His back to go from Samuel, God gave Him another heart; and all those signs happened that day.  [10] When they came there to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met Him; and the Spirit of God came mightily on Him, and He prophesied among them.  [11] When all who knew him before saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said to one another, “What is this that has come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?”\n     [12] One from the same place answered, “Who is their father?” Therefore it became a proverb, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”  [13] When he had finished prophesying, he came to the high place.\n     [14] Saul’s uncle said to him and to his servant, “Where did you go?”\n    He said, “To seek the donkeys. When we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel.”\n     [15] Saul’s uncle said, “Please tell me what Samuel said to you.”\n     [16] Saul said to his uncle, “He told us plainly that the donkeys were found.” But concerning the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he didn’t tell him.\n     [17] Samuel called the people together to Yahweh to Mizpah;  [18] and He said to the children of Israel, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says ‘I brought Israel up out of Egypt and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you.’  [19] But you have today rejected your God, who Himself saves you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and you have said to Him, ‘No! Set a king over us!’ Now therefore present yourselves before Yahweh by your tribes and by your thousands.”\n     [20] So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was chosen.  [21] He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families and the family of the Matrites was chosen. Then Saul the son of Kish was chosen; but when they looked for him, he could not be found.  [22] Therefore they asked of Yahweh further, “Is there yet a man to come here?”\n    Yahweh answered, “Behold, He has hidden Himself among the baggage.”\n     [23] They ran and got him there. When he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.  [24] Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see Him whom Yahweh has chosen, that there is no one like Him among all the people?”\n    All the people shouted and said, “Long live the king!”\n     [25] Then Samuel told the people the regulations of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book and laid it up before Yahweh. Samuel sent all the people away, every man to His house.  [26] Saul also went to His house in Gibeah; and the army went with Him, whose hearts God had touched.  [27] But certain worthless fellows said, “How could this man save us?” They despised him, and brought him no tribute. But he held his peace.\n"

I will make this dishonor all Israel.”\n     [3] The elders of Jabesh said to him, “Give us seven days, that we may send messengers to all the borders of Israel; and then, if there is no one to save us, we will come out to you.”  [4] Then the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul, and spoke these words in the ears of the people, then all the people lifted up their voice and wept.\n     [5] Behold, Saul came following the oxen out of the field; and Saul said, “What ails the people that they weep?” They told him the words of the men of Jabesh.  [6] God’s Spirit came mightily on Saul when He heard those words, and His anger burned hot.  [7] He took a yoke of oxen and cut them in pieces, then sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, “Whoever doesn’t come out after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to His oxen.” The dread of Yahweh fell on the people, and they came out as one man.

Those who remained were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.\n     [12] The people said to Samuel, “Who is he who said, ‘Shall Saul reign over us?’ Bring those men, that we may put them to death!”\n     [13] Saul said, “No man shall be put to death today; for today Yahweh has rescued Israel.”\n     [14] Then Samuel said to the people, “Come!

[10] They cried to Yahweh, and said, ‘We have sinned, because we have forsaken Yahweh and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth; but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you.’  [11] Yahweh sent Jerubbaal, Bedan, Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side; and you lived in safety.\n     [12] “When you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, you said to me, ‘No, but a king shall reign over us,’ when Yahweh your God was your king.

He sent the rest of the people to their own tents.  [3] Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear!”  [4] All Israel heard that Saul had struck the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel was considered an abomination to the Philistines. The people were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal.  [5] The Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel: thirty thousand chariots, six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude. They came up and encamped in Michmash, eastward of Beth Aven.  [6] When the men of Israel saw that they were in trouble (for the people were distressed), then the people hid themselves in caves, in thickets, in rocks, in tombs, and in pits.  [7] Now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; but as for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.  [8] He stayed seven days, according to the time set by Samuel; but Samuel didn’t come to Gilgal, and the people were scattering from him.  [9] Saul said, “Bring the burnt offering to me here, and the peace offerings.” He offered the burnt offering.\n     [10] It came to pass that as soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might greet him.  [11] Samuel said, “What have you done?”\n    Saul said, “Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that you didn’t come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at Michmash,  [12] therefore I said, ‘Now the Philistines will come down on me to Gilgal, and I haven’t entreated the favor of Yahweh.’ I forced myself therefore, and offered the burnt offering.”\n     [13] Samuel said to Saul, “You have done foolishly. You have not kept the commandment of Yahweh your God, which He commanded you; for now Yahweh would have established your kingdom on Israel forever.  [14] But now your kingdom will not continue. Yahweh has sought for Himself a man after His own heart, and Yahweh has appointed Him to be prince over His people, because you have not kept that which Yahweh commanded you.”\n     [15] Samuel arose, and went from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. Saul counted the people who were present with him, about six hundred men.  [16] Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people who were present with them, stayed in Geba of Benjamin; but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.  [17] The raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned to the way that leads to Ophrah, to the land of Shual;  [18] another company turned the way to Beth Horon; and another company turned the way of the border that looks down on the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.  [19] Now there was no blacksmith found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, “Lest the Hebrews make themselves swords or spears”;  [20] but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, each man to sharpen his own plowshare, mattock, ax, and sickle.  [21] The price was one payim each to sharpen mattocks, plowshares, pitchforks, axes, and goads.  [22] So it came to pass in the day of battle that neither sword nor spear was found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan; but Saul and Jonathan his son had them.\n     [23] The garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.\n"

Let’s go over to the Philistines’ garrison that is on the other side.” But he didn’t tell his father.  [2] Saul stayed in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree which is in Migron; and the people who were with him were about six hundred men,  [3] including Ahijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli the priest of Yahweh in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. The people didn’t know that Jonathan was gone.\n     [4] Between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines’ garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side and a rocky crag on the other side; and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.  [5] The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.  [6] Jonathan said to the young man who bore His armor, “Come! Let’s go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised. It may be that Yahweh will work for us, for there is no restraint on Yahweh to save by many or by few.”\n     [7] His armor bearer said to him, “Do all that is in your heart. Go, and behold, I am with you according to your heart.”\n     [8] Then Jonathan said, “Behold, we will pass over to the men, and we will reveal ourselves to them.  [9] If they say this to us, ‘Wait until we come to you!’ then we will stand still in our place and will not go up to them.  [10] But if they say this, ‘Come up to us!’ then we will go up, for Yahweh has delivered them into our hand. This shall be the sign to us.”\n     [11] Both of them revealed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines; and the Philistines said, “Behold, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they had hidden themselves!”  [12] The men of the garrison answered Jonathan and His armor bearer, and said, “Come up to us, and we will show you something!”\n    Jonathan said to His armor bearer, “Come up after me, for Yahweh has delivered them into the hand of Israel.”  [13] Jonathan climbed up on his hands and on his feet, and his armor bearer after him, and they fell before Jonathan; and his armor bearer killed them after him.  [14] That first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow’s length in an acre of land.\n     [15] There was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison and the raiders also trembled; and the earth quaked, so there was an exceedingly great trembling.  [16] The watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and behold, the multitude melted away and scattered.  [17] Then Saul said to the people who were with him, “Count now, and see who is missing from us.” When they had counted, behold, Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there.\n     [18] Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring God’s ark here.” For God’s ark was with the children of Israel at that time.  [19] While Saul talked to the priest, the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased; and Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand!”\n     [20] Saul and all the people who were with him were gathered together, and came to the battle; and behold, they were all striking each other with their swords in very great confusion.  [21] Now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines before and who went up with them into the camp from all around, even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.  [22] Likewise all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.  [23] So Yahweh saved Israel that day; and the battle passed over by Beth Aven.\n     [24] The men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had adjured the people, saying, “Cursed is the man who eats any food until it is evening, and I am avenged of my enemies.” So none of the people tasted food.\n     [25] All the people came into the forest; and there was honey on the ground.  [26] When the people had come to the forest, behold, honey was dripping, but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath.  [27] But Jonathan didn’t hear when his father commanded the people with the oath. Therefore he put out the end of the rod that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes brightened.  [28] Then one of the people answered, and said, “Your father directly commanded the people with an oath, saying, ‘Cursed is the man who eats food today.’” So the people were faint.\n     [29] Then Jonathan said, “My father has troubled the land. Please look how my eyes have brightened because I tasted a little of this honey.  [30] How much more, if perhaps the people had eaten freely today of the plunder of their enemies which they found? For now there has been no great slaughter among the Philistines.”  [31] They struck the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. The people were very faint;  [32] and the people pounced on the plunder, and took sheep, cattle, and calves, and killed them on the ground; and the people ate them with the blood.  [33] Then they told Saul, saying, “Behold, the people are sinning against Yahweh, in that they eat meat with the blood.”\n    He said, “You have dealt treacherously. Roll a large stone to me today!”  [34] Saul said, “Disperse yourselves among the people, and tell them, ‘Every man bring me here His ox, and every man His sheep, and kill them here, and eat; and don’t sin against Yahweh in eating meat with the blood.’” All the people brought every man His ox with Him that night, and killed them there.\n     [35] Saul built an altar to Yahweh. This was the first altar that He built to Yahweh.  [36] Saul said, “Let’s go down after the Philistines by night, and take plunder among them until the morning light. Let’s not leave a man of them.”\n    They said, “Do whatever seems good to you.”\n    Then the priest said, “Let’s draw near here to God.”\n     [37] Saul asked counsel of God: “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you deliver them into the hand of Israel?” But He didn’t answer Him that day.  [38] Saul said, “Draw near here, all you chiefs of the people, and know and see in whom this sin has been today.  [39] For as Yahweh lives, who saves Israel, though it is in Jonathan my son, He shall surely die.” But there was not a man among all the people who answered Him.  [40] Then he said to all Israel, “You be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.”\n    The people said to Saul, “Do what seems good to you.”\n     [41] Therefore Saul said to Yahweh, the God of Israel, “Show the right.”\n    Jonathan and Saul were chosen, but the people escaped.\n     [42] Saul said, “Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son.”\n    Jonathan was selected.\n     [43] Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done!”\n    Jonathan told him, and said, “I certainly did taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; and behold, I must die.”\n     [44] Saul said, “God do so and more also; for you shall surely die, Jonathan.”\n     [45] The people said to Saul, “Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? Far from it! As Yahweh lives, there shall not one hair of His head fall to the ground, for He has worked with God today!” So the people rescued Jonathan, so He didn’t die.  [46] Then Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.\n     [47] Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side: against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines. Wherever he turned himself, he defeated them.  [48] He did valiantly and struck the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who plundered them.  [49] Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchishua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal.  [50] The name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the captain of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle.  [51] Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.\n     [52] There was severe war against the Philistines all the days of Saul; and when Saul saw any mighty man or any valiant man, he took him into his service.\n"

[2] Yahweh of Armies says, ‘I remember what Amalek did to Israel, how He set Himself against Him on the way when He came up out of Egypt.  [3] Now go and strike Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and don’t spare them; but kill both man and woman, infant and nursing baby, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.’”\n     [4] Saul summoned the people, and counted them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of Judah.  [5] Saul came to the city of Amalek, and set an ambush in the valley.  [6] Saul said to the Kenites, “Go, depart, go down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt.” So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.\n     [7] Saul struck the Amalekites, from Havilah as you go to Shur, which is before Egypt.  [8] He took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.  [9] But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep, of the cattle, of the fat calves, of the lambs, and all that was good, and were not willing to utterly destroy them; but everything that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.\n     [10] Then Yahweh’s word came to Samuel, saying,  [11] “It grieves me that I have set up Saul to be king, for He has turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments.” Samuel was angry; and He cried to Yahweh all night.\n     [12] Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and Samuel was told, saying, “Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself, turned, passed on, and went down to Gilgal.”\n     [13] Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said to Him, “You are blessed by Yahweh! I have performed the commandment of Yahweh.”\n     [14] Samuel said, “Then what does this bleating of the sheep in my ears and the lowing of the cattle which I hear mean?”\n     [15] Saul said, “They have brought them from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the cattle, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God. We have utterly destroyed the rest.”\n     [16] Then Samuel said to Saul, “Stay, and I will tell you what Yahweh said to me last night.”\n    He said to Him, “Say on.”\n     [17] Samuel said, “Though you were little in your own sight, weren’t you made the head of the tribes of Israel? Yahweh anointed you king over Israel;  [18] and Yahweh sent you on a journey, and said, ‘Go, and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.’  [19] Why then didn’t you obey Yahweh’s voice, but took the plunder, and did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight?”\n     [20] Saul said to Samuel, “But I have obeyed Yahweh’s voice, and have gone the way which Yahweh sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.  [21] But the people took of the plunder, sheep and cattle, the best of the devoted things, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God in Gilgal.”\n     [22] Samuel said, “Has Yahweh as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying Yahweh’s voice? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.  [23] For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because you have rejected Yahweh’s word, He has also rejected you from being king.”\n     [24] Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of Yahweh and your words, because I feared the people and obeyed their voice.  [25] Now therefore, please pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship Yahweh.”\n     [26] Samuel said to Saul, “I will not return with you; for you have rejected Yahweh’s word, and Yahweh has rejected you from being king over Israel.”  [27] As Samuel turned around to go away, Saul grabbed the skirt of his robe, and it tore.  [28] Samuel said to Him, “Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today, and has given it to a neighbor of yours who is better than you.  [29] Also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man, that he should repent.”\n     [30] Then He said, “I have sinned; yet please honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel, and come back with me, that I may worship Yahweh your God.”\n     [31] So Samuel went back with Saul; and Saul worshiped Yahweh.  [32] Then Samuel said, “Bring Agag the king of the Amalekites here to me!”\n    Agag came to him cheerfully. Agag said, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.”\n     [33] Samuel said, “As your sword has made women childless, so your mother will be childless among women!” Then Samuel cut Agag in pieces before Yahweh in Gilgal.\n     [34] Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.  [35] Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of His death, but Samuel mourned for Saul. Yahweh grieved that He had made Saul king over Israel.\n"

I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided a king for myself among His sons.”\n     [2] Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears it, He will kill me.”\n    Yahweh said, “Take a heifer with you, and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh.’  [3] Call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do. You shall anoint to me him whom I name to you.”\n     [4] Samuel did that which Yahweh spoke, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet Him trembling, and said, “Do you come peaceably?”\n     [5] He said, “Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh. Sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.” He sanctified Jesse and His sons, and called them to the sacrifice.  [6] When they had come, He looked at Eliab, and said, “Surely Yahweh’s anointed is before Him.”\n     [7] But Yahweh said to Samuel, “Don’t look on His face, or on the height of His stature, because I have rejected Him; for I don’t see as man sees. For man looks at the outward appearance, but Yahweh looks at the heart.”\n     [8] Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made Him pass before Samuel. He said, “Yahweh has not chosen this one, either.”  [9] Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. He said, “Yahweh has not chosen this one, either.”  [10] Jesse made seven of His sons to pass before Samuel. Samuel said to Jesse, “Yahweh has not chosen these.”  [11] Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all your children here?”\n    He said, “There remains yet the youngest. Behold, he is keeping the sheep.”\n    Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and get him, for we will not sit down until he comes here.”\n     [12] He sent, and brought Him in. Now He was ruddy, with a handsome face and good appearance. Yahweh said, “Arise! Anoint Him, for this is He.”\n     [13] Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed Him in the middle of His brothers. Then Yahweh’s Spirit came mightily on David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up and went to Ramah.  [14] Now Yahweh’s Spirit departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Yahweh troubled Him.  [15] Saul’s servants said to Him, “See now, an evil spirit from God troubles you.  [16] Let our lord now command your servants who are in front of you to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the harp. Then when the evil spirit from God is on you, He will play with His hand, and you will be well.”\n     [17] Saul said to his servants, “Provide me now a man who can play well, and bring him to me.”\n     [18] Then one of the young men answered and said, “Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skillful in playing, a mighty man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a handsome person; and Yahweh is with Him.”\n     [19] Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, “Send me David your son, who is with the sheep.”\n     [20] Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a container of wine, and a young goat, and sent them by David his son to Saul.  [21] David came to Saul and stood before him. He loved him greatly; and he became his armor bearer.  [22] Saul sent to Jesse, saying, “Please let David stand before me, for he has found favor in my sight.”  [23] When the spirit from God was on Saul, David took the harp and played with His hand; so Saul was refreshed and was well, and the evil spirit departed from Him.\n"

          "content": "     [1] Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle; and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah in Ephesdammim.  [2] Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and encamped in the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.  [3] The Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.  [4] A champion out of the camp of the Philistines named Goliath of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span went out.  [5] He had a helmet of bronze on his head, and he wore a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of bronze.  [6] He had bronze shin armor on his legs and a bronze javelin between his shoulders.  [7] The staff of his spear was like a weaver’s beam; and his spear’s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron. His shield bearer went before him.  [8] He stood and cried to the armies of Israel, and said to them, “Why have you come out to set your battle in array? Am I not a Philistine, and you servants to Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me.  [9] If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then will we be your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then you will be our servants and serve us.”  [10] The Philistine said, “I defy the armies of Israel today! Give me a man, that we may fight together!”\n     [11] When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.  [12] Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons. The man was an elderly old man in the days of Saul.  [13] The three oldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle; and the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.  [14] David was the youngest; and the three oldest followed Saul.  [15] Now David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Bethlehem.\n     [16] The Philistine came near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.\n     [17] Jesse said to David his son, “Now take for your brothers an ephah of this parched grain and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers;  [18] and bring these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand; and see how your brothers are doing, and bring back news.”  [19] Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.\n     [20] David rose up early in the morning and left the sheep with a keeper, and took the provisions and went, as Jesse had commanded him. He came to the place of the wagons as the army which was going out to the fight shouted for the battle.  [21] Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array, army against army.  [22] David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage and ran to the army, and came and greeted his brothers.  [23] As he talked with them, behold, the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came up out of the ranks of the Philistines, and said the same words; and David heard them.  [24] All the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were terrified.  [25] The men of Israel said, “Have you seen this man who has come up? He has surely come up to defy Israel. The king will give great riches to the man who kills him, and will give him his daughter, and will make his father’s house tax-free in Israel.”\n     [26] David spoke to the men who stood by Him, saying, “What shall be done to the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that He should defy the armies of the living God?”\n     [27] The people answered him in this way, saying, “So shall it be done to the man who kills him.”\n     [28] Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab’s anger burned against David, and he said, “Why have you come down? With whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride and the evil of your heart; for you have come down that you might see the battle.”\n     [29] David said, “What have I now done? Is there not a cause?”  [30] He turned away from him toward another, and spoke like that again; and the people answered him again the same way.  [31] When the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed them before Saul; and he sent for him.  [32] David said to Saul, “Let no man’s heart fail because of him. Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.”\n     [33] Saul said to David, “You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.”\n     [34] David said to Saul, “Your servant was keeping his father’s sheep; and when a lion or a bear came and took a lamb out of the flock,  [35] I went out after him, struck him, and rescued it out of his mouth. When he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, struck him, and killed him.  [36] Your servant struck both the lion and the bear. This uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, since He has defied the armies of the living God.”  [37] David said, “Yahweh, who delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear, will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine.”\n    Saul said to David, “Go! Yahweh will be with you.”\n     [38] Saul dressed David with his clothing. He put a helmet of bronze on his head, and he clad him with a coat of mail.  [39] David strapped his sword on his clothing and he tried to move, for he had not tested it. David said to Saul, “I can’t go with these, for I have not tested them.” Then David took them off.\n     [40] He took his staff in his hand, and chose for himself five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the pouch of his shepherd’s bag which he had. His sling was in his hand; and he came near to the Philistine.  [41] The Philistine walked and came near to David; and the man who bore the shield went before him.  [42] When the Philistine looked around and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and had a good looking face.  [43] The Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?” The Philistine cursed David by his gods.  [44] The Philistine said to David, “Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the sky and to the animals of the field.”\n     [45] Then David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin; but I come to you in the name of Yahweh of Armies, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.  [46] Today, Yahweh will deliver you into my hand. I will strike you and take your head from off you. I will give the dead bodies of the army of the Philistines today to the birds of the sky and to the wild animals of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,  [47] and that all this assembly may know that Yahweh doesn’t save with sword and spear; for the battle is Yahweh’s, and He will give you into our hand.”\n     [48] When the Philistine arose, and walked and came near to meet David, David hurried and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.  [49] David put his hand in his bag, took a stone and slung it, and struck the Philistine in his forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the earth.  [50] So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and struck the Philistine and killed him; but there was no sword in David’s hand.  [51] Then David ran, stood over the Philistine, took his sword, drew it out of its sheath, killed him, and cut off his head with it.\n    When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.  [52] The men of Israel and of Judah arose and shouted, and pursued the Philistines as far as Gai and to the gates of Ekron. The wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath and to Ekron.  [53] The children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they plundered their camp.  [54] David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his armor in his tent.  [55] When Saul saw David go out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the army, “Abner, whose son is this youth?”\n    Abner said, “As your soul lives, O king, I can’t tell.”\n     [56] The king said, “Inquire whose son the young man is!”\n     [57] As David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.  [58] Saul said to him, “Whose son are you, you young man?”\n    David answered, “I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.”\n"

[2] Saul took him that day, and wouldn’t let him go home to his father’s house any more.  [3] Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.  [4] Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him and gave it to David with his clothing, even including his sword, his bow, and his sash.\n     [5] David went out wherever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely; and Saul set him over the men of war. It was good in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul’s servants.\n     [6] As they came, when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul with tambourines, with joy, and with instruments of music.  [7] The women sang to one another as they played, and said,\n  “Saul has slain his thousands,\n    and David his ten thousands.”\n     [8] Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased him. He said, “They have credited David with ten thousands, and they have only credited me with thousands. What can he have more but the kingdom?”  [9] Saul watched David from that day and forward.  [10] On the next day, an evil spirit from God came mightily on Saul, and He prophesied in the middle of the house. David played with His hand, as He did day by day. Saul had His spear in His hand;  [11] and Saul threw the spear, for he said, “I will pin David to the wall!” David escaped from his presence twice.  [12] Saul was afraid of David, because Yahweh was with Him, and had departed from Saul.  [13] Therefore Saul removed him from his presence, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.\n     [14] David behaved Himself wisely in all His ways; and Yahweh was with Him.  [15] When Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he stood in awe of him.  [16] But all Israel and Judah loved David; for he went out and came in before them.  [17] Saul said to David, “Behold, my elder daughter Merab. I will give her to you as wife. Only be valiant for me, and fight Yahweh’s battles.” For Saul said, “Don’t let my hand be on Him, but let the hand of the Philistines be on Him.”\n     [18] David said to Saul, “Who am I, and what is my life, or my father’s family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?”\n     [19] But at the time when Merab, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David, she was given to Adriel the Meholathite as wife.\n     [20] Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved David; and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.  [21] Saul said, I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Therefore Saul said to David a second time, “You shall today be my son-in-law.”\n     [22] Saul commanded his servants, “Talk with David secretly, and say, ‘Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you. Now therefore be the king’s son-in-law.’”\n     [23] Saul’s servants spoke those words in the ears of David. David said, “Does it seem to you a light thing to be the king’s son-in-law, since I am a poor man and little known?”\n     [24] The servants of Saul told him, saying, “David spoke like this.”\n     [25] Saul said, “Tell David, ‘The king desires no dowry except one hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king’s enemies.’” Now Saul thought he would make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.  [26] When his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king’s son-in-law. Before the deadline,  [27] David arose and went, he and his men, and killed two hundred men of the Philistines. Then David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king’s son-in-law. Then Saul gave him Michal his daughter as wife.  [28] Saul saw and knew that Yahweh was with David; and Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved Him.  [29] Saul was even more afraid of David; and Saul was David’s enemy continually.\n     [30] Then the princes of the Philistines went out; and as often as they went out, David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul, so that his name was highly esteemed.\n"

[3] I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will talk with my father about you; and if I see anything, I will tell you.”\n     [4] Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father, and said to him, “Don’t let the king sin against his servant, against David; because he has not sinned against you, and because his works have been very good toward you;  [5] for He put His life in His hand and struck the Philistine, and Yahweh worked a great victory for all Israel. You saw it and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood, to kill David without a cause?”\n     [6] Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan; and Saul swore, “As Yahweh lives, He shall not be put to death.”\n     [7] Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. Then Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as before.\n     [8] There was war again. David went out and fought with the Philistines, and killed them with a great slaughter; and they fled before him.\n     [9] An evil spirit from Yahweh was on Saul as He sat in His house with His spear in His hand; and David was playing music with His hand.  [10] Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away out of Saul’s presence; and he stuck the spear into the wall. David fled and escaped that night.  [11] Saul sent messengers to David’s house to watch him and to kill him in the morning. Michal, David’s wife, told him, saying, “If you don’t save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed.”  [12] So Michal let David down through the window. He went away, fled, and escaped.  [13] Michal took the teraphim and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats’ hair at its head and covered it with clothes.  [14] When Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, “He is sick.”\n     [15] Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, “Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill him.”  [16] When the messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed, with the pillow of goats’ hair at its head.\n     [17] Saul said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me like this and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?”\n    Michal answered Saul, “He said to me, ‘Let me go! Why should I kill you?’”\n     [18] Now David fled and escaped, and came to Samuel at Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. He and Samuel went and lived in Naioth.  [19] Saul was told, saying, “Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.”\n     [20] Saul sent messengers to seize David; and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, God’s Spirit came on Saul’s messengers, and they also prophesied.  [21] When Saul was told, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.  [22] Then he also went to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Secu: and he asked, “Where are Samuel and David?”\n    One said, “Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.”\n     [23] He went there to Naioth in Ramah. Then God’s Spirit came on Him also, and He went on, and prophesied, until He came to Naioth in Ramah.  [24] He also stripped off his clothes. He also prophesied before Samuel and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”\n"

          "content": "     [1] David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said to Jonathan, “What have I done? What is my iniquity? What is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?”\n     [2] He said to him, “Far from it; you will not die. Behold, my father does nothing either great or small, but that he discloses it to me. Why would my father hide this thing from me? It is not so.”\n     [3] David swore moreover, and said, “Your father knows well that I have found favor in your eyes; and He says, ‘Don’t let Jonathan know this, lest He be grieved;’ but truly as Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, there is but a step between me and death.”\n     [4] Then Jonathan said to David, “Whatever your soul desires, I will even do it for you.”\n     [5] David said to Jonathan, “Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to dine with the king; but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field to the third day at evening.  [6] If your father misses me at all, then say, ‘David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem, his city; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family.’  [7] If he says, ‘It is well,’ your servant shall have peace; but if he is angry, then know that evil is determined by him.  [8] Therefore deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of Yahweh with you; but if there is iniquity in me, kill me yourself, for why should you bring me to your father?”\n     [9] Jonathan said, “Far be it from you; for if I should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come on you, then wouldn’t I tell you that?”\n     [10] Then David said to Jonathan, “Who will tell me if your father answers you roughly?”\n     [11] Jonathan said to David, “Come! Let’s go out into the field.” They both went out into the field.  [12] Jonathan said to David, “By Yahweh, the God of Israel, when I have sounded out my father about this time tomorrow, or the third day, behold, if there is good toward David, won’t I then send to you and disclose it to you?  [13] Yahweh do so to Jonathan and more also, should it please my father to do you evil, if I don’t disclose it to you and send you away, that you may go in peace. May Yahweh be with you as He has been with my father.  [14] You shall not only show me the loving kindness of Yahweh while I still live, that I not die;  [15] but you shall also not cut off your kindness from my house forever, no, not when Yahweh has cut off every one of the enemies of David from the surface of the earth.”  [16] So Jonathan made a covenant with David’s house, saying, “Yahweh will require it at the hand of David’s enemies.”\n     [17] Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul.  [18] Then Jonathan said to him, “Tomorrow is the new moon, and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty.  [19] When you have stayed three days, go down quickly and come to the place where you hid yourself when this started, and remain by the stone Ezel.  [20] I will shoot three arrows on its side, as though I shot at a mark.  [21] Behold, I will send the boy, saying, ‘Go, find the arrows!’ If I tell the boy, ‘Behold, the arrows are on this side of you. Take them;’ then come, for there is peace to you and no danger, as Yahweh lives.  [22] But if I say this to the boy, ‘Behold, the arrows are beyond you,’ then go your way, for Yahweh has sent you away.  [23] Concerning the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold, Yahweh is between you and me forever.”\n     [24] So David hid himself in the field. When the new moon had come, the king sat himself down to eat food.  [25] The king sat on his seat, as at other times, even on the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul’s side, but David’s place was empty.  [26] Nevertheless Saul didn’t say anything that day, for he thought, “Something has happened to him. He is not clean. Surely he is not clean.”\n     [27] On the next day after the new moon, the second day, David’s place was empty. Saul said to Jonathan his son, “Why didn’t the son of Jesse come to eat, either yesterday, or today?”\n     [28] Jonathan answered Saul, “David earnestly asked permission of me to go to Bethlehem.  [29] He said, ‘Please let me go, for our family has a sacrifice in the city. My brother has commanded me to be there. Now, if I have found favor in your eyes, please let me go away and see my brothers.’ Therefore he has not come to the king’s table.”\n     [30] Then Saul’s anger burned against Jonathan, and he said to him, “You son of a perverse rebellious woman, don’t I know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness?  [31] For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, you will not be established, nor will your kingdom. Therefore now send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die!”\n     [32] Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, “Why should he be put to death? What has he done?”\n     [33] Saul cast his spear at him to strike him. By this Jonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death.  [34] So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David, because his father had treated him shamefully.\n     [35] In the morning, Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little boy with him.  [36] He said to his boy, “Run, find now the arrows which I shoot.” As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.  [37] When the boy had come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the boy, and said, “Isn’t the arrow beyond you?”  [38] Jonathan cried after the boy, “Go fast! Hurry! Don’t delay!” Jonathan’s boy gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.  [39] But the boy didn’t know anything. Only Jonathan and David knew the matter.  [40] Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy, and said to him, “Go, carry them to the city.”\n     [41] As soon as the boy was gone, David arose out of the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times. They kissed one another and wept with one another, and David wept the most.  [42] Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace, because we have both sworn in Yahweh’s name, saying, ‘Yahweh is between me and you, and between my offspring and your offspring, forever.’” He arose and departed; and Jonathan went into the city.\n"

Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said to him, “Why are you alone, and no man with you?”  [2] David said to Ahimelech the priest, “The king has commanded me to do something, and has said to me, ‘Let no one know anything about the business about which I send you, and what I have commanded you. I have sent the young men to a certain place.’  [3] Now therefore what is under your hand? Please give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatever is available.”\n     [4] The priest answered David, and said, “I have no common bread, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.”\n     [5] David answered the priest, and said to him, “Truly, women have been kept from us as usual these three days. When I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was only a common journey. How much more then today shall their vessels be holy?”  [6] So the priest gave Him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the show bread that was taken from before Yahweh, to be replaced with hot bread in the day when it was taken away.\n     [7] Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before Yahweh; and His name was Doeg the Edomite, the best of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul.\n     [8] David said to Ahimelech, “Isn’t there here under your hand spear or sword? For I haven’t brought my sword or my weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste.”\n     [9] The priest said, “Behold, the sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah, is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you would like to take that, take it, for there is no other except that here.”\n    David said, “There is none like that. Give it to me.”\n     [10] David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.  [11] The servants of Achish said to him, “Isn’t this David the king of the land? Didn’t they sing to one another about him in dances, saying,\n  ‘Saul has slain his thousands,\n    and David his ten thousands?’”\n     [12] David laid up these words in his heart, and was very afraid of Achish the king of Gath.  [13] He changed his behavior before them and pretended to be insane in their hands, and scribbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down on his beard.  [14] Then Achish said to his servants, “Look, you see the man is insane. Why then have you brought him to me?  [15] Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? Should this fellow come into my house?”\n"

[2] Everyone who was in distress, everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented gathered themselves to him; and he became captain over them. There were with him about four hundred men.  [3] David went from there to Mizpeh of Moab; and He said to the king of Moab, “Please let my father and my mother come out to you, until I know what God will do for me.”  [4] He brought them before the king of Moab; and they lived with him all the time that David was in the stronghold.  [5] The prophet Gad said to David, “Don’t stay in the stronghold. Depart, and go into the land of Judah.”\n    Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hereth.\n     [6] Saul heard that David was discovered, with the men who were with him. Now Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing around him.  [7] Saul said to his servants who stood around him, “Hear now, you Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse give everyone of you fields and vineyards? Will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds?  [8] Is that why all of you have conspired against me, and there is no one who discloses to me when my son makes a treaty with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you who is sorry for me, or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as it is today?”\n     [9] Then Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants of Saul, answered and said, “I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.  [10] He inquired of Yahweh for Him, gave Him food, and gave Him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.”\n     [11] Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests who were in Nob; and they all came to the king.  [12] Saul said, “Hear now, you son of Ahitub.”\n    He answered, “Here I am, my lord.”\n     [13] Saul said to Him, “Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given Him bread, and a sword, and have inquired of God for Him, that He should rise against me, to lie in wait, as it is today?”\n     [14] Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, “Who among all your servants is so faithful as David, who is the king’s son-in-law, captain of your body guard, and honored in your house?  [15] Have I today begun to inquire of God for Him? Be it far from me! Don’t let the king impute anything to His servant, nor to all the house of my father; for your servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.”\n     [16] The king said, “You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father’s house.”  [17] The king said to the guard who stood about Him, “Turn and kill the priests of Yahweh, because their hand also is with David, and because they knew that He fled and didn’t disclose it to me.” But the servants of the king wouldn’t put out their hand to fall on the priests of Yahweh.\n     [18] The king said to Doeg, “Turn and attack the priests!”\n    Doeg the Edomite turned, and he attacked the priests, and he killed on that day eighty-five people who wore a linen ephod.  [19] He struck Nob, the city of the priests, with the edge of the sword—both men and women, children and nursing babies, and cattle, donkeys, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.  [20] One of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled after David.  [21] Abiathar told David that Saul had slain Yahweh’s priests.\n     [22] David said to Abiathar, “I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I am responsible for the death of all the persons of your father’s house.  [23] Stay with me. Don’t be afraid, for he who seeks my life seeks your life. You will be safe with me.”\n"

How much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?”\n     [4] Then David inquired of Yahweh yet again. Yahweh answered Him, and said, “Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.”\n     [5] David and his men went to Keilah and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their livestock, and killed them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.\n     [6] When Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, he came down with an ephod in his hand.\n     [7] Saul was told that David had come to Keilah. Saul said, “God has delivered Him into my hand, for He is shut in by entering into a town that has gates and bars.”  [8] Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men.  [9] David knew that Saul was devising mischief against him. He said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod here.”  [10] Then David said, “O Yahweh, the God of Israel, your servant has surely heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah to destroy the city for my sake.

Yahweh, the God of Israel, I beg you, tell your servant.”\n    Yahweh said, “He will come down.”\n     [12] Then David said, “Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul?”\n    Yahweh said, “They will deliver you up.”\n     [13] Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah and went wherever they could go. Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah; and he gave up going there.  [14] David stayed in the wilderness in the strongholds, and remained in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph. Saul sought Him every day, but God didn’t deliver Him into His hand.  [15] David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life. David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the woods.\n     [16] Jonathan, Saul’s son, arose and went to David into the woods, and strengthened His hand in God.  [17] He said to him, “Don’t be afraid, for the hand of Saul my father won’t find you; and you will be king over Israel, and I will be next to you; and Saul my father knows that also.”  [18] They both made a covenant before Yahweh. Then David stayed in the woods and Jonathan went to His house.\n     [19] Then the Ziphites came up to Saul to Gibeah, saying, “Doesn’t David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the woods, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of the desert?  [20] Now therefore, O king, come down. According to all the desire of your soul to come down; and our part will be to deliver him up into the king’s hand.”\n     [21] Saul said, “You are blessed by Yahweh, for you have had compassion on me.  [22] Please go make yet more sure, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who has seen him there; for I have been told that he is very cunning.  [23] See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hides himself; and come again to me with certainty, and I will go with you. It shall happen, if he is in the land, that I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.”\n     [24] They arose, and went to Ziph before Saul; but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah on the south of the desert.  [25] Saul and his men went to seek him. When David was told, he went down to the rock, and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. When Saul heard that, he pursued David in the wilderness of Maon.  [26] Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain; and David hurried to get away for fear of Saul, for Saul and his men surrounded David and his men to take them.  [27] But a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Hurry and come, for the Philistines have made a raid on the land!”  [28] So Saul returned from pursuing David, and went against the Philistines. Therefore they called that place Sela Hammahlekoth.\n     [29] David went up from there and lived in the strongholds of En Gedi.\n"

[3] He came to the sheep pens by the way, where there was a cave; and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were staying in the innermost parts of the cave.  [4] David’s men said to Him, “Behold, the day of which Yahweh said to you, ‘Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to Him as it shall seem good to you.’” Then David arose and cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe secretly.  [5] Afterward, David’s heart struck him because he had cut off Saul’s skirt.  [6] He said to His men, “Yahweh forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, Yahweh’s anointed, to stretch out my hand against Him, since He is Yahweh’s anointed.”  [7] So David checked his men with these words, and didn’t allow them to rise against Saul. Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.  [8] David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave and cried after Saul, saying, “My lord the king!”\n    When Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and showed respect.  [9] David said to Saul, “Why do you listen to men’s words, saying, ‘Behold, David seeks to harm you?’  [10] Behold, today your eyes have seen how Yahweh had delivered you today into my hand in the cave. Some urged me to kill you, but I spared you. I said, ‘I will not stretch out my hand against my lord, for He is Yahweh’s anointed.’  [11] Moreover, my father, behold, yes, see the skirt of your robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe and didn’t kill you, know and see that there is neither evil nor disobedience in my hand. I have not sinned against you, though you hunt for my life to take it.  [12] May Yahweh judge between me and you, and may Yahweh avenge me of you; but my hand will not be on you.  [13] As the proverb of the ancients says, ‘Out of the wicked comes wickedness;’ but my hand will not be on you.  [14] Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom do you pursue? A dead dog? A flea?  [15] May Yahweh therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and you, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of your hand.”\n     [16] It came to pass, when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, “Is that your voice, my son David?” Saul lifted up his voice and wept.  [17] He said to David, “You are more righteous than I; for you have done good to me, whereas I have done evil to you.  [18] You have declared today how you have dealt well with me, because when Yahweh had delivered me up into your hand, you didn’t kill me.  [19] For if a man finds His enemy, will He let Him go away unharmed? Therefore may Yahweh reward you good for that which you have done to me today.  [20] Now, behold, I know that you will surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand.  [21] Swear now therefore to me by Yahweh that you will not cut off my offspring after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father’s house.”\n     [22] David swore to Saul. Saul went home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.\n"

[2] There was a man in Maon whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great. He had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats; and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.  [3] Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail. This woman was intelligent and had a beautiful face; but the man was surly and evil in his doings. He was of the house of Caleb.  [4] David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.  [5] David sent ten young men; and David said to the young men, “Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name.  [6] Tell him, ‘Long life to you! Peace be to you! Peace be to your house! Peace be to all that you have!  [7] Now I have heard that you have shearers. Your shepherds have now been with us, and we didn’t harm them.

Please give whatever comes to your hand to your servants and to your son David.’”\n     [9] When David’s young men came, they spoke to Nabal all those words in the name of David, and waited.\n     [10] Nabal answered David’s servants and said, “Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants who break away from their masters these days.  [11] Shall I then take my bread, my water, and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men who I don’t know where they come from?”\n     [12] So David’s young men turned on their way and went back, and came and told him all these words.\n     [13] David said to his men, “Every man put on his sword!”\n    Every man put on his sword. David also put on his sword. About four hundred men followed David, and two hundred stayed by the baggage.\n     [14] But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, “Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to greet our master; and he insulted them.  [15] But the men were very good to us, and we were not harmed, and we didn’t miss anything as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields.

[17] Now therefore know and consider what you will do; for evil is determined against our master and against all his house, for he is such a worthless fellow that one can’t speak to him.”\n     [18] Then Abigail hurried and took two hundred loaves of bread, two containers of wine, five sheep ready dressed, five seahs of parched grain, one hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on donkeys.  [19] She said to her young men, “Go on before me. Behold, I am coming after you.” But she didn’t tell her husband, Nabal.  [20] As she rode on her donkey, and came down hidden by the mountain, behold, David and his men came down toward her, and she met them.\n     [21] Now David had said, “Surely in vain I have kept all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained to him. He has returned me evil for good.  [22] God do so to the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave of all that belongs to Him by the morning light so much as one who urinates on a wall.”\n     [23] When Abigail saw David, she hurried and got off her donkey, and fell before David on her face and bowed herself to the ground.  [24] She fell at his feet and said, “On me, my lord, on me be the blame! Please let your servant speak in your ears. Hear the words of your servant.  [25] Please don’t let my lord pay attention to this worthless fellow, Nabal, for as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his name, and folly is with him; but I, your servant, didn’t see my lord’s young men whom you sent.  [26] Now therefore, my lord, as Yahweh lives and as your soul lives, since Yahweh has withheld you from blood guiltiness and from avenging yourself with your own hand, now therefore let your enemies and those who seek evil to my lord be as Nabal.  [27] Now this present which your servant has brought to my lord, let it be given to the young men who follow my lord.  [28] Please forgive the trespass of your servant. For Yahweh will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord fights Yahweh’s battles. Evil will not be found in you all your days.  [29] Though men may rise up to pursue you and to seek your soul, yet the soul of my lord will be bound in the bundle of life with Yahweh your God. He will sling out the souls of your enemies as from a sling’s pocket.  [30] It will come to pass, when Yahweh has done to my lord according to all the good that He has spoken concerning you, and has appointed you prince over Israel,  [31] that this shall be no grief to you, nor offense of heart to my lord, either that you have shed blood without cause, or that my lord has avenged Himself. When Yahweh has dealt well with my lord, then remember your servant.”\n     [32] David said to Abigail, “Blessed is Yahweh, the God of Israel, who sent you today to meet me!  [33] Blessed is your discretion, and blessed are you, who have kept me today from blood guiltiness, and from avenging myself with my own hand.  [34] For indeed, as Yahweh the God of Israel lives, who has withheld me from harming you, unless you had hurried and come to meet me, surely there wouldn’t have been left to Nabal by the morning light so much as one who urinates on a wall.”\n     [35] So David received from her hand that which she had brought him. Then he said to her, “Go up in peace to your house. Behold, I have listened to your voice and have granted your request.”\n     [36] Abigail came to Nabal; and behold, he held a feast in his house like the feast of a king. Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk. Therefore she told him nothing until the morning light.  [37] In the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal, his wife told him these things; and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.  [38] About ten days later, Yahweh struck Nabal, so that He died.  [39] When David heard that Nabal was dead, He said, “Blessed is Yahweh, who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept back His servant from evil. Yahweh has returned the evildoing of Nabal on His own head.”\n    David sent and spoke concerning Abigail, to take her to Himself as wife.  [40] When David’s servants had come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke to her, saying, “David has sent us to you, to take you to him as wife.”\n     [41] She arose and bowed herself with her face to the earth, and said, “Behold, your servant is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.”  [42] Abigail hurriedly arose and rode on a donkey with her five maids who followed her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.  [43] David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they both became his wives.\n     [44] Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.\n"

[3] Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert, by the way. But David stayed in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.  [4] David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul had certainly come.  [5] Then David arose and came to the place where Saul had encamped; and David saw the place where Saul lay, with Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his army. Saul lay within the place of the wagons, and the people were encamped around him.\n     [6] Then David answered and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother of Joab, saying, “Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp?”\n    Abishai said, “I will go down with you.”  [7] So David and Abishai came to the people by night; and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people lay around him.  [8] Then Abishai said to David, “God has delivered up your enemy into your hand today. Now therefore please let me strike Him with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not strike Him the second time.”\n     [9] David said to Abishai, “Don’t destroy Him, for who can stretch out His hand against Yahweh’s anointed, and be guiltless?”  [10] David said, “As Yahweh lives, Yahweh will strike Him; or His day shall come to die, or He shall go down into battle and perish.  [11] Yahweh forbid that I should stretch out my hand against Yahweh’s anointed; but now please take the spear that is at His head and the jar of water, and let’s go.”\n     [12] So David took the spear and the jar of water from Saul’s head, and they went away. No man saw it, or knew it, nor did any awake; for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from Yahweh had fallen on them.  [13] Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain far away, a great space being between them;  [14] and David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, “Don’t you answer, Abner?”\n    Then Abner answered, “Who are you who calls to the king?”\n     [15] David said to Abner, “Aren’t you a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not kept watch over your lord the king? For one of the people came in to destroy your lord the king.  [16] This thing isn’t good that you have done. As Yahweh lives, you are worthy to die, because you have not kept watch over your lord, Yahweh’s anointed. Now see where the king’s spear is, and the jar of water that was at His head.”\n     [17] Saul recognized David’s voice, and said, “Is this your voice, my son David?”\n    David said, “It is my voice, my lord, O king.”  [18] He said, “Why does my lord pursue his servant? For what have I done? What evil is in my hand?  [19] Now therefore, please let my lord the king hear the words of His servant. If it is so that Yahweh has stirred you up against me, let Him accept an offering. But if it is the children of men, they are cursed before Yahweh; for they have driven me out today that I shouldn’t cling to Yahweh’s inheritance, saying, ‘Go, serve other gods!’  [20] Now therefore, don’t let my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of Yahweh; for the king of Israel has come out to seek a flea, as when one hunts a partridge in the mountains.”\n     [21] Then Saul said, “I have sinned. Return, my son David; for I will no more do you harm, because my life was precious in your eyes today. Behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.”\n     [22] David answered, “Behold the spear, O king! Let one of the young men come over and get it.  [23] Yahweh will render to every man His righteousness and His faithfulness; because Yahweh delivered you into my hand today, and I wouldn’t stretch out my hand against Yahweh’s anointed.  [24] Behold, as your life was respected today in my eyes, so let my life be respected in Yahweh’s eyes, and let Him deliver me out of all oppression.”\n     [25] Then Saul said to David, “You are blessed, my son David. You will both do mightily, and will surely prevail.”\n    So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.\n"

There is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of Israel. So I will escape out of his hand.”  [2] David arose and passed over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.  [3] David lived with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal’s wife.  [4] Saul was told that David had fled to Gath, so he stopped looking for him.\n     [5] David said to Achish, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may dwell there. For why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?”  [6] Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: therefore Ziklag belongs to the kings of Judah to this day.  [7] The number of the days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.\n     [8] David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites; for those were the inhabitants of the land who were of old, on the way to Shur, even to the land of Egypt.

Saul had sent away those who had familiar spirits and the wizards out of the land.\n     [4] The Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and encamped in Shunem; and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped in Gilboa.  [5] When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.  [6] When Saul inquired of Yahweh, Yahweh didn’t answer Him by dreams, by Urim, or by prophets.  [7] Then Saul said to his servants, “Seek for me a woman who has a familiar spirit, that I may go to her and inquire of her.”\n    His servants said to him, “Behold, there is a woman who has a familiar spirit at Endor.”\n     [8] Saul disguised himself and put on other clothing, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night. Then he said, “Please consult for me by the familiar spirit, and bring me up whomever I shall name to you.”\n     [9] The woman said to him, “Behold, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off those who have familiar spirits and the wizards out of the land.

For you are Saul!”\n     [13] The king said to her, “Don’t be afraid! What do you see?”\n    The woman said to Saul, “I see a god coming up out of the earth.”\n     [14] He said to her, “What does he look like?”\n    She said, “An old man comes up. He is covered with a robe.” Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and showed respect.\n     [15] Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me, to bring me up?”\n    Saul answered, “I am very distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God has departed from me, and answers me no more, by prophets, or by dreams. Therefore I have called you, that you may make known to me what I shall do.”\n     [16] Samuel said, “Why then do you ask me, since Yahweh has departed from you and has become your adversary?  [17] Yahweh has done to you as He spoke by me. Yahweh has torn the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbor, even to David.  [18] Because you didn’t obey Yahweh’s voice, and didn’t execute His fierce wrath on Amalek, therefore Yahweh has done this thing to you today.  [19] Moreover Yahweh will deliver Israel also with you into the hand of the Philistines; and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. Yahweh will deliver the army of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines.”\n     [20] Then Saul fell immediately his full length on the earth, and was terrified, because of Samuel’s words. There was no strength in him, for he had eaten no bread all day long or all night long.\n     [21] The woman came to Saul and saw that he was very troubled, and said to him, “Behold, your servant has listened to your voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have listened to your words which you spoke to me.  [22] Now therefore, please listen also to the voice of your servant, and let me set a morsel of bread before you. Eat, that you may have strength when you go on your way.”\n     [23] But he refused, and said, “I will not eat.” But his servants, together with the woman, constrained him; and he listened to their voice. So he arose from the earth and sat on the bed.  [24] The woman had a fattened calf in the house. She hurried and killed it; and she took flour and kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread of it.

They didn’t kill any, but carried them off and went their way.  [3] When David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, their sons, and their daughters were taken captive.  [4] Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep.  [5] David’s two wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.  [6] David was greatly distressed, for the people spoke of stoning Him, because the souls of all the people were grieved, every man for His sons and for His daughters; but David strengthened Himself in Yahweh His God.  [7] David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, “Please bring the ephod here to me.”\n    Abiathar brought the ephod to David.  [8] David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “If I pursue after this troop, will I overtake them?”\n    He answered Him, “Pursue, for you will surely overtake them, and will without fail recover all.”\n     [9] So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those who were left behind stayed.  [10] But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who were so faint that they couldn’t go over the brook Besor.  [11] They found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he ate; and they gave him water to drink.  [12] They gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins. When he had eaten, his spirit came again to him; for he had eaten no bread, and drank no water for three days and three nights.  [13] David asked him, “To whom do you belong? Where are you from?”\n    He said, “I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I got sick.  [14] We made a raid on the South of the Cherethites, and on that which belongs to Judah, and on the South of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.”\n     [15] David said to Him, “Will you bring me down to this troop?”\n    He said, “Swear to me by God that you will not kill me and not deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this troop.”\n     [16] When he had brought him down, behold, they were spread around over all the ground, eating, drinking, and dancing, because of all the great plunder that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.  [17] David struck them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day. Not a man of them escaped from there, except four hundred young men who rode on camels and fled.  [18] David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken, and David rescued his two wives.  [19] There was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither plunder, nor anything that they had taken. David brought them all back.  [20] David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before those other livestock, and said, “This is David’s plunder.”\n     [21] David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to stay at the brook Besor; and they went out to meet David, and to meet the people who were with him. When David came near to the people, he greeted them.  [22] Then all the wicked men and worthless fellows of those who went with David answered and said, “Because they didn’t go with us, we will not give them anything of the plunder that we have recovered, except to every man his wife and his children, that he may lead them away and depart.”\n     [23] Then David said, “Do not do so, my brothers, with that which Yahweh has given to us, who has preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.  [24] Who will listen to you in this matter? For as his share is who goes down to the battle, so shall his share be who stays with the baggage. They shall share alike.”  [25] It was so from that day forward that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.\n     [26] When David came to Ziklag, He sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah, even to His friends, saying, “Behold, a present for you from the plunder of Yahweh’s enemies.”  [27] He sent it to those who were in Bethel, to those who were in Ramoth of the South, to those who were in Jattir,  [28] to those who were in Aroer, to those who were in Siphmoth, to those who were in Eshtemoa,  [29] to those who were in Racal, to those who were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, to those who were in the cities of the Kenites,  [30] to those who were in Hormah, to those who were in Borashan, to those who were in Athach,  [31] to those who were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men used to stay.\n"

[12] They mourned, wept, and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan His son, and for the people of Yahweh, and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.\n     [13] David said to the young man who told him, “Where are you from?”\n    He answered, “I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite.”\n     [14] David said to Him, “Why were you not afraid to stretch out your hand to destroy Yahweh’s anointed?”  [15] David called one of the young men and said, “Go near, and cut him down!” He struck him so that he died.  [16] David said to Him, “Your blood be on your head, for your mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I have slain Yahweh’s anointed.’”\n     [17] David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son  [18] (and he commanded them to teach the children of Judah the song of the bow; behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):\n   [19] “Your glory, Israel, was slain on your high places!\n    How the mighty have fallen!\n   [20] Don’t tell it in Gath.\n    Don’t publish it in the streets of Ashkelon,\n  lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,\n    lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.\n   [21] You mountains of Gilboa,\n    let there be no dew or rain on you, and no fields of offerings;\n    for there the shield of the mighty was defiled and cast away,\n    the shield of Saul was not anointed with oil.\n   [22] From the blood of the slain,\n    from the fat of the mighty,\n    Jonathan’s bow didn’t turn back.\n    Saul’s sword didn’t return empty.\n   [23] Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives.\n    In their death, they were not divided.\n  They were swifter than eagles.\n    They were stronger than lions.\n   [24] You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,\n    who clothed you delicately in scarlet,\n    who put ornaments of gold on your clothing.\n   [25] How the mighty have fallen in the middle of the battle!\n    Jonathan was slain on your high places.\n   [26] I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan.\n    You have been very pleasant to me.\n    Your love to me was wonderful,\n    surpassing the love of women.\n   [27] How the mighty have fallen,\n    and the weapons of war have perished!”\n"

          "content": "     [1] After this, David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?”\n    Yahweh said to Him, “Go up.”\n    David said, “Where shall I go up?”\n    He said, “To Hebron.”\n     [2] So David went up there with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.  [3] David brought up his men who were with him, every man with his household. They lived in the cities of Hebron.  [4] The men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. They told David, “The men of Jabesh Gilead were those who buried Saul.”  [5] David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead, and said to them, “Blessed are you by Yahweh, that you have shown this kindness to your lord, even to Saul, and have buried Him.  [6] Now may Yahweh show loving kindness and truth to you. I also will reward you for this kindness, because you have done this thing.  [7] Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.”\n     [8] Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul’s army, had taken Ishbosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim.  [9] He made him king over Gilead, over the Ashurites, over Jezreel, over Ephraim, over Benjamin, and over all Israel.  [10] Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.  [11] The time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.\n     [12] Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.  [13] Joab the son of Zeruiah and David’s servants went out, and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool.  [14] Abner said to Joab, “Please let the young men arise and compete before us!”\n    Joab said, “Let them arise!”  [15] Then they arose and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin and for Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of David’s servants.  [16] They each caught his opponent by the head and thrust his sword in his fellow’s side; so they fell down together. Therefore that place in Gibeon was called Helkath Hazzurim.  [17] The battle was very severe that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before David’s servants.  [18] The three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Asahel was as light of foot as a wild gazelle.  [19] Asahel pursued Abner. He didn’t turn to the right hand or to the left from following Abner.\n     [20] Then Abner looked behind him and said, “Is that you, Asahel?”\n    He answered, “It is.”\n     [21] Abner said to him, “Turn away to your right hand or to your left, and grab one of the young men, and take his armor.” But Asahel would not turn away from following him.  [22] Abner said again to Asahel, “Turn away from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I look Joab your brother in the face?”  [23] However, he refused to turn away. Therefore Abner with the back end of the spear struck him in the body, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there and died in the same place. As many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.\n     [24] But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner. The sun went down when they had come to the hill of Ammah, that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.  [25] The children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill.  [26] Then Abner called to Joab, and said, “Shall the sword devour forever? Don’t you know that it will be bitterness in the latter end? How long will it be then, before you ask the people to return from following their brothers?”\n     [27] Joab said, “As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely then in the morning the people would have gone away, and not each followed His brother.”  [28] So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people stood still and pursued Israel no more, and they fought no more.  [29] Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim.\n     [30] Joab returned from following Abner; and when he had gathered all the people together, nineteen men of David’s and Asahel were missing.  [31] But David’s servants had struck Benjamin Abner’s men so that three hundred sixty men died.  [32] They took up Asahel and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was in Bethlehem. Joab and his men went all night, and the day broke on them at Hebron.\n"

[2] Sons were born to David in Hebron. His firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;  [3] and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;  [4] and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;  [5] and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David’s wife. These were born to David in Hebron.\n     [6] While there was war between Saul’s house and David’s house, Abner made himself strong in Saul’s house.  [7] Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah; and Ishbosheth said to Abner, “Why have you gone in to my father’s concubine?”\n     [8] Then Abner was very angry about Ishbosheth’s words, and said, “Am I a dog’s head that belongs to Judah? Today I show kindness to your father Saul’s house, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David; and yet you charge me today with a fault concerning this woman!  [9] God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as Yahweh has sworn to David, I don’t do even so to Him:  [10] to transfer the kingdom from Saul’s house, and to set up David’s throne over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.”\n     [11] He could not answer Abner another word, because he was afraid of him.\n     [12] Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, “Whose is the land?” and saying, “Make your alliance with me, and behold, my hand will be with you to bring all Israel around to you.”\n     [13] David said, “Good. I will make a treaty with you, but one thing I require of you. That is, you will not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when you come to see my face.”  [14] David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, saying, “Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I was given to marry for one hundred foreskins of the Philistines.”\n     [15] Ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband, Paltiel the son of Laish.  [16] Her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, “Go! Return!” and he returned.\n     [17] Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, “In times past, you sought for David to be king over you.  [18] Now then do it! For Yahweh has spoken of David, saying, ‘By the hand of my servant David, I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.’”\n     [19] Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin; and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel and to the whole house of Benjamin.  [20] So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. David made Abner and the men who were with him a feast.  [21] Abner said to David, “I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your soul desires.” David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.\n     [22] Behold, David’s servants and Joab came from a raid and brought in a great plunder with them; but Abner was not with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.  [23] When Joab and all the army who was with him had come, they told Joab, “Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he has gone in peace.”\n     [24] Then Joab came to the king and said, “What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you. Why is it that you have sent him away, and he is already gone?  [25] You know Abner the son of Ner. He came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you do.”\n     [26] When Joab had come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David didn’t know it.  [27] When Abner had returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the middle of the gate to speak with him quietly, and struck him there in the body, so that he died for the blood of Asahel his brother.  [28] Afterward, when David heard it, He said, “I and my kingdom are guiltless before Yahweh forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner.  [29] Let it fall on the head of Joab and on all his father’s house. Let there not fail from the house of Joab one who has a discharge, or who is a leper, or who leans on a staff, or who falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.”  [30] So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.\n     [31] David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, “Tear your clothes, and clothe yourselves with sackcloth, and mourn in front of Abner.” King David followed the bier.  [32] They buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice and wept at Abner’s grave; and all the people wept.  [33] The king lamented for Abner, and said, “Should Abner die as a fool dies?  [34] Your hands weren’t bound, and your feet weren’t put into fetters. As a man falls before the children of iniquity, so you fell.”\n    All the people wept again over him.  [35] All the people came to urge David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David swore, saying, “God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread or anything else, until the sun goes down.”\n     [36] All the people took notice of it, and it pleased them, as whatever the king did pleased all the people.  [37] So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to kill Abner the son of Ner.  [38] The king said to his servants, “Don’t you know that a prince and a great man has fallen today in Israel?  [39] I am weak today, though anointed king. These men, the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me. May Yahweh reward the evildoer according to His wickedness.”\n"

The name of one was Baanah and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin (for Beeroth also is considered a part of Benjamin;  [3] and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have lived as foreigners there until today).\n     [4] Now Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son who was lame in his feet. He was five years old when the news came about Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel; and his nurse picked him up and fled. As she hurried to flee, he fell and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth.\n     [5] The sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went out and came at about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth as he took his rest at noon.  [6] They came there into the middle of the house as though they would have fetched wheat, and they struck him in the body; and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.  [7] Now when they came into the house as he lay on his bed in his bedroom, they struck him, killed him, beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night.  [8] They brought the head of Ishbosheth to David to Hebron, and said to the king, “Behold, the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life! Yahweh has avenged my lord the king today of Saul and of His offspring.”\n     [9] David answered Rechab and Baanah His brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, “As Yahweh lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,  [10] when someone told me, ‘Behold, Saul is dead,’ thinking that he brought good news, I seized him and killed him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news.  [11] How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house on his bed, should I not now require his blood from your hand, and rid the earth of you?”  [12] David commanded his young men, and they killed them, cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron.

Yahweh said to you, ‘You will be shepherd of my people Israel, and you will be prince over Israel.’”  [3] So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh; and they anointed David king over Israel.\n     [4] David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.  [5] In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.\n     [6] The king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying, “The blind and the lame will keep you out of here,” thinking, “David can’t come in here.”  [7] Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion. This is David’s city.  [8] David said on that day, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites, let him go up to the watercourse and strike those lame and blind, who are hated by David’s soul.” Therefore they say, “The blind and the lame can’t come into the house.”\n     [9] David lived in the stronghold, and called it David’s city. David built around from Millo and inward.  [10] David grew greater and greater, for Yahweh, the God of Armies, was with Him.  [11] Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, with cedar trees, carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house.  [12] David perceived that Yahweh had established Him king over Israel, and that He had exalted His kingdom for His people Israel’s sake.\n     [13] David took more concubines and wives for himself out of Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron; and more sons and daughters were born to David.  [14] These are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,  [15] Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,  [16] Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.\n     [17] When the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David, but David heard about it and went down to the stronghold.

Will you deliver them into my hand?”\n    Yahweh said to David, “Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into your hand.”\n     [20] David came to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there. Then He said, “Yahweh has broken my enemies before me, like the breach of waters.” Therefore He called the name of that place Baal Perazim.  [21] They left their images there, and David and his men took them away.\n     [22] The Philistines came up yet again and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.  [23] When David inquired of Yahweh, He said, “You shall not go up. Circle around behind them, and attack them in front of the mulberry trees.  [24] When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, then stir yourself up; for then Yahweh has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.”\n     [25] David did so, as Yahweh commanded Him, and struck the Philistines all the way from Geba to Gezer.\n"

[3] They set God’s ark on a new cart, and brought it out of Abinadab’s house that was on the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.  [4] They brought it out of Abinadab’s house which was in the hill, with God’s ark; and Ahio went before the ark.  [5] David and all the house of Israel played before Yahweh with all kinds of instruments made of cypress wood, with harps, with stringed instruments, with tambourines, with castanets, and with cymbals.\n     [6] When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached for God’s ark and took hold of it, for the cattle stumbled.  [7] Yahweh’s anger burned against Uzzah, and God struck Him there for His error; and He died there by God’s ark.  [8] David was displeased because Yahweh had broken out against Uzzah; and He called that place Perez Uzzah to this day.  [9] David was afraid of Yahweh that day; and He said, “How could Yahweh’s ark come to me?”  [10] So David would not move Yahweh’s ark to be with Him in David’s city; but David carried it aside into Obed-Edom the Gittite’s house.  [11] Yahweh’s ark remained in Obed-Edom the Gittite’s house three months; and Yahweh blessed Obed-Edom and all His house.  [12] King David was told, “Yahweh has blessed the house of Obed-Edom, and all that belongs to Him, because of God’s ark.”\n    So David went and brought up God’s ark from the house of Obed-Edom into David’s city with joy.

[15] So David and all the house of Israel brought up Yahweh’s ark with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet.\n     [16] As Yahweh’s ark came into David’s city, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out through the window and saw King David leaping and dancing before Yahweh; and she despised Him in her heart.  [17] They brought in Yahweh’s ark, and set it in its place in the middle of the tent that David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh.  [18] When David had finished offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, He blessed the people in the name of Yahweh of Armies.  [19] He gave to all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to everyone a portion of bread, dates, and raisins. So all the people departed, each to his own house.\n     [20] Then David returned to bless his household. Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, “How glorious the king of Israel was today, who uncovered himself today in the eyes of his servants’ maids, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!”\n     [21] David said to Michal, “It was before Yahweh, who chose me above your father, and above all His house, to appoint me prince over the people of Yahweh, over Israel. Therefore I will celebrate before Yahweh.  [22] I will be yet more undignified than this, and will be worthless in my own sight.

Joram brought with him vessels of silver, vessels of gold, and vessels of bronze.  [11] King David also dedicated these to Yahweh, with the silver and gold that He dedicated of all the nations which He subdued—  [12] of Syria, of Moab, of the children of Ammon, of the Philistines, of Amalek, and of the plunder of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.\n     [13] David earned a reputation when he returned from striking down eighteen thousand men of the Syrians in the Valley of Salt.

David said, “Mephibosheth?”\n    He answered, “Behold, your servant!”\n     [7] David said to him, “Don’t be afraid, for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father’s sake, and will restore to you all the land of Saul your father.

David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.\n     [3] But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, “Do you think that David honors your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Hasn’t David sent his servants to you to search the city, to spy it out, and to overthrow it?”\n     [4] So Hanun took David’s servants, shaved off one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.

The king said, “Wait at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.”\n     [6] When the children of Ammon saw that they had become odious to David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth Rehob and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah with one thousand men, and the men of Tob twelve thousand men.  [7] When David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the army of the mighty men.  [8] The children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate. The Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah were by themselves in the field.

But David stayed at Jerusalem.  [2] At evening, David arose from his bed and walked on the roof of the king’s house. From the roof, he saw a woman bathing, and the woman was very beautiful to look at.  [3] David sent and inquired after the woman. One said, “Isn’t this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, Uriah the Hittite’s wife?”\n     [4] David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him, and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness); and she returned to her house.  [5] The woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, “I am with child.”\n     [6] David sent to Joab, “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” Joab sent Uriah to David.  [7] When Uriah had come to him, David asked him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.  [8] David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house and wash your feet.” Uriah departed out of the king’s house, and a gift from the king was sent after him.  [9] But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and didn’t go down to his house.  [10] When they had told David, saying, “Uriah didn’t go down to his house,” David said to Uriah, “Haven’t you come from a journey? Why didn’t you go down to your house?”\n     [11] Uriah said to David, “The ark, Israel, and Judah, are staying in tents; and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are encamped in the open field. Shall I then go into my house to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing!”\n     [12] David said to Uriah, “Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart.” So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next day.  [13] When David had called him, he ate and drank before him; and he made him drunk. At evening, he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but didn’t go down to his house.  [14] In the morning, David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah.  [15] He wrote in the letter, saying, “Send Uriah to the forefront of the hottest battle, and retreat from him, that he may be struck and die.”\n     [16] When Joab kept watch on the city, he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were.  [17] The men of the city went out and fought with Joab. Some of the people fell, even of David’s servants; and Uriah the Hittite died also.  [18] Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;  [19] and he commanded the messenger, saying, “When you have finished telling all the things concerning the war to the king,  [20] it shall be that, if the king’s wrath arise, and he asks you, ‘Why did you go so near to the city to fight? Didn’t you know that they would shoot from the wall?  [21] Who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Didn’t a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?’ then you shall say, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.’”\n     [22] So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.  [23] The messenger said to David, “The men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field; and we were on them even to the entrance of the gate.  [24] The shooters shot at your servants from off the wall; and some of the king’s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.”\n     [25] Then David said to the messenger, “Tell Joab, ‘Don’t let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Make your battle stronger against the city, and overthrow it.’ Encourage him.”\n     [26] When Uriah’s wife heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.  [27] When the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to His house, and she became His wife and bore Him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased Yahweh.\n"

[2] The rich man had very many flocks and herds,  [3] but the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and raised. It grew up together with him and with his children. It ate of his own food, drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was like a daughter to him.  [4] A traveler came to the rich man, and he didn’t want to take of his own flock and of his own herd to prepare for the wayfaring man who had come to him, but took the poor man’s lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him.”\n     [5] David’s anger burned hot against the man, and He said to Nathan, “As Yahweh lives, the man who has done this deserves to die!  [6] He must restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing and because he had no pity!”\n     [7] Nathan said to David, “You are the man! This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: ‘I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul.  [8] I gave you your master’s house and your master’s wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that would have been too little, I would have added to you many more such things.  [9] Why have you despised Yahweh’s word, to do that which is evil in His sight? You have struck Uriah the Hittite with the sword, have taken His wife to be your wife, and have slain Him with the sword of the children of Ammon.  [10] Now therefore the sword will never depart from your house, because you have despised me and have taken Uriah the Hittite’s wife to be your wife.’\n     [11] “This is what Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes and give them to your neighbor, and He will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.  [12] For you did this secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.’”\n     [13] David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against Yahweh.”\n    Nathan said to David, “Yahweh also has put away your sin. You will not die.  [14] However, because by this deed you have given great occasion to Yahweh’s enemies to blaspheme, the child also who is born to you will surely die.”  [15] Then Nathan departed to His house.\n    Yahweh struck the child that Uriah’s wife bore to David, and He was very sick.  [16] David therefore begged God for the child; and David fasted, and went in and lay all night on the ground.  [17] The elders of his house arose beside him, to raise him up from the earth; but he would not, and he didn’t eat bread with them.  [18] On the seventh day, the child died. David’s servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, “Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him and he didn’t listen to our voice. How will he then harm himself if we tell him that the child is dead?”\n     [19] But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; and David said to his servants, “Is the child dead?”\n    They said, “He is dead.”\n     [20] Then David arose from the earth, and washed and anointed Himself, and changed His clothing; and He came into Yahweh’s house, and worshiped. Then He came to His own house; and when He requested, they set bread before Him and He ate.  [21] Then his servants said to him, “What is this that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive, but when the child was dead, you rose up and ate bread.”\n     [22] He said, “While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, ‘Who knows whether Yahweh will not be gracious to me, that the child may live?’  [23] But now he is dead. Why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me.”\n     [24] David comforted Bathsheba His wife, and went in to her, and lay with her. She bore a son, and He called His name Solomon. Yahweh loved Him;  [25] and He sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and He named Him Jedidiah, for Yahweh’s sake.\n     [26] Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.  [27] Joab sent messengers to David, and said, “I have fought against Rabbah. Yes, I have taken the city of waters.  [28] Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city and take it; lest I take the city, and it be called by my name.”\n     [29] David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah, and fought against it and took it.  [30] He took the crown of their king from off his head; and its weight was a talent of gold, and in it were precious stones; and it was set on David’s head. He brought a great quantity of plunder out of the city.  [31] He brought out the people who were in it, and put them to work under saws, under iron picks, under axes of iron, and made them go to the brick kiln; and he did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.\n"

[2] Amnon was so troubled that he became sick because of his sister Tamar, for she was a virgin, and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her.  [3] But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David’s brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man.  [4] He said to him, “Why, son of the king, are you so sad from day to day? Won’t you tell me?”\n    Amnon said to him, “I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.”\n     [5] Jonadab said to him, “Lay down on your bed and pretend to be sick. When your father comes to see you, tell him, ‘Please let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and prepare the food in my sight, that I may see it and eat it from her hand.’”\n     [6] So Amnon lay down and faked being sick. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, “Please let my sister Tamar come and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.”\n     [7] Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, “Go now to your brother Amnon’s house, and prepare food for him.”  [8] So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was lying down. She took dough, kneaded it, made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.  [9] She took the pan and poured them out before him, but he refused to eat. Amnon said, “Have all men leave me.” Then every man went out from him.  [10] Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food into the room, that I may eat from your hand.” Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the room to Amnon her brother.  [11] When she had brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, “Come, lie with me, my sister!”\n     [12] She answered him, “No, my brother, do not force me! For no such thing ought to be done in Israel. Don’t you do this folly!  [13] As for me, where would I carry my shame? And as for you, you will be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.”\n     [14] However, he would not listen to her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her and lay with her.  [15] Then Amnon hated her with exceedingly great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. Amnon said to her, “Arise, be gone!”\n     [16] She said to him, “Not so, because this great wrong in sending me away is worse than the other that you did to me!”\n    But he would not listen to her.  [17] Then he called his servant who ministered to him, and said, “Now put this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.”\n     [18] She had a garment of various colors on her, for the king’s daughters who were virgins dressed in such robes. Then his servant brought her out and bolted the door after her.  [19] Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her garment of various colors that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head and went her way, crying aloud as she went.  [20] Absalom her brother said to her, “Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now hold your peace, my sister. He is your brother. Don’t take this thing to heart.”\n    So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom’s house.  [21] But when King David heard of all these things, he was very angry.  [22] Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.\n     [23] After two full years, Absalom had sheep shearers in Baal Hazor, which is beside Ephraim; and Absalom invited all the king’s sons.  [24] Absalom came to the king and said, “See now, your servant has sheep shearers. Please let the king and his servants go with your servant.”\n     [25] The king said to Absalom, “No, my son, let’s not all go, lest we be burdensome to you.” He pressed him; however he would not go, but blessed him.\n     [26] Then Absalom said, “If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.”\n    The king said to him, “Why should he go with you?”\n     [27] But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.  [28] Absalom commanded his servants, saying, “Mark now, when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine; and when I tell you, ‘Strike Amnon,’ then kill him. Don’t be afraid. Haven’t I commanded you? Be courageous, and be valiant!”\n     [29] The servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man got up on his mule and fled.\n     [30] While they were on the way, the news came to David, saying, “Absalom has slain all the king’s sons, and there is not one of them left!”\n     [31] Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.  [32] Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, answered, “Don’t let my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men, the king’s sons, for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.  [33] Now therefore don’t let my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead; for only Amnon is dead.”  [34] But Absalom fled. The young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, many people were coming by way of the hillside behind him.  [35] Jonadab said to the king, “Behold, the king’s sons are coming! It is as your servant said.”  [36] As soon as he had finished speaking, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voices and wept. The king also and all his servants wept bitterly.\n     [37] But Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. David mourned for his son every day.  [38] So Absalom fled and went to Geshur, and was there three years.  [39] King David longed to go out to Absalom, for he was comforted concerning Amnon, since he was dead.\n"

[2] Joab sent to Tekoa and brought a wise woman from there, and said to her, “Please act like a mourner, and put on mourning clothing, please, and don’t anoint yourself with oil; but be as a woman who has mourned a long time for the dead.  [3] Go in to the king and speak like this to him.” So Joab put the words in her mouth.\n     [4] When the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, showed respect, and said, “Help, O king!”\n     [5] The king said to her, “What ails you?”\n    She answered, “Truly I am a widow, and my husband is dead.  [6] Your servant had two sons; and they both fought together in the field, and there was no one to part them, but the one struck the other and killed him.  [7] Behold, the whole family has risen against your servant, and they say, ‘Deliver him who struck his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he killed, and so destroy the heir also.’ Thus they would quench my coal which is left, and would leave to my husband neither name nor remainder on the surface of the earth.”\n     [8] The king said to the woman, “Go to your house, and I will give a command concerning you.”\n     [9] The woman of Tekoa said to the king, “My lord, O king, may the iniquity be on me, and on my father’s house; and may the king and his throne be guiltless.”\n     [10] The king said, “Whoever says anything to you, bring him to me, and he will not bother you any more.”\n     [11] Then she said, “Please let the king remember Yahweh your God, that the avenger of blood destroy not any more, lest they destroy my son.”\n    He said, “As Yahweh lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the earth.”\n     [12] Then the woman said, “Please let your servant speak a word to my lord the king.”\n    He said, “Say on.”\n     [13] The woman said, “Why then have you devised such a thing against the people of God? For in speaking this word the king is as one who is guilty, in that the king does not bring home again His banished one.  [14] For we must die, and are like water spilled on the ground, which can’t be gathered up again; neither does God take away life, but devises means, that He who is banished not be an outcast from Him.  [15] Now therefore, seeing that I have come to speak this word to my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid. Your servant said, ‘I will now speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.’  [16] For the king will hear, to deliver His servant out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.  [17] Then your servant said, ‘Please let the word of my lord the king bring rest; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad. May Yahweh, your God, be with you.’”\n     [18] Then the king answered the woman, “Please don’t hide anything from me that I ask you.”\n    The woman said, “Let my lord the king now speak.”\n     [19] The king said, “Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?”\n    The woman answered, “As your soul lives, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken; for your servant Joab urged me, and he put all these words in the mouth of your servant.  [20] Your servant Joab has done this thing to change the face of the matter. My lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.”\n     [21] The king said to Joab, “Behold now, I have granted this thing. Go therefore, and bring the young man Absalom back.”\n     [22] Joab fell to the ground on his face, showed respect, and blessed the king. Joab said, “Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord, O king, in that the king has performed the request of his servant.”\n     [23] So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.  [24] The king said, “Let him return to his own house, but let him not see my face.” So Absalom returned to his own house, and didn’t see the king’s face.  [25] Now in all Israel there was no one to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty. From the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no defect in him.  [26] When he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every year’s end that he cut it; because it was heavy on him, therefore he cut it), he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, after the king’s weight.  [27] Three sons were born to Absalom, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar. She was a woman with a beautiful face.  [28] Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem, and he didn’t see the king’s face.  [29] Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but he would not come to him. Then he sent again a second time, but he would not come.  [30] Therefore he said to his servants, “Behold, Joab’s field is near mine, and he has barley there. Go and set it on fire.” So Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.\n     [31] Then Joab arose and came to Absalom to his house, and said to him, “Why have your servants set my field on fire?”\n     [32] Absalom answered Joab, “Behold, I sent to you, saying, ‘Come here, that I may send you to the king, to say, “Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to be there still. Now therefore, let me see the king’s face; and if there is iniquity in me, let him kill me.”’”\n     [33] So Joab came to the king and told him; and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king; and the king kissed Absalom.\n"

          "content": "     [1] After this, Absalom prepared a chariot and horses for himself, and fifty men to run before him.  [2] Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate. When any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him, and said, “What city are you from?”\n    He said, “Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.”\n     [3] Absalom said to him, “Behold, your matters are good and right; but there is no man deputized by the king to hear you.”  [4] Absalom said moreover, “Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who has any suit or cause might come to me, and I would do him justice!”  [5] It was so, that when any man came near to bow down to him, he stretched out his hand, took hold of him, and kissed him.  [6] Absalom did this sort of thing to all Israel who came to the king for judgment. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.\n     [7] At the end of forty years, Absalom said to the king, “Please let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to Yahweh, in Hebron.  [8] For your servant vowed a vow while I stayed at Geshur in Syria, saying, ‘If Yahweh shall indeed bring me again to Jerusalem, then I will serve Yahweh.’”\n     [9] The king said to him, “Go in peace.”\n    So he arose and went to Hebron.  [10] But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, ‘Absalom is king in Hebron!’”\n     [11] Two hundred men went with Absalom out of Jerusalem, who were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they didn’t know anything.  [12] Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. The conspiracy was strong, for the people increased continually with Absalom.  [13] A messenger came to David, saying, “The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.”\n     [14] David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, “Arise! Let’s flee, or else none of us will escape from Absalom. Hurry to depart, lest he overtake us quickly and bring down evil on us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword.”\n     [15] The king’s servants said to the king, “Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king chooses.”\n     [16] The king went out, and all his household after him. The king left ten women, who were concubines, to keep the house.  [17] The king went out, and all the people after him; and they stayed in Beth Merhak.  [18] All his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.\n     [19] Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why do you also go with us? Return, and stay with the king; for you are a foreigner and also an exile. Return to your own place.  [20] Whereas you came but yesterday, should I today make you go up and down with us, since I go where I may? Return, and take back your brothers. Mercy and truth be with you.”\n     [21] Ittai answered the king and said, “As Yahweh lives, and as my lord the king lives, surely in what place my lord the king is, whether for death or for life, your servant will be there also.”\n     [22] David said to Ittai, “Go and pass over.” Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones who were with him.  [23] All the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over. The king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over toward the way of the wilderness.  [24] Behold, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with Him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down God’s ark; and Abiathar went up until all the people finished passing out of the city.  [25] The king said to Zadok, “Carry God’s ark back into the city. If I find favor in Yahweh’s eyes, He will bring me again, and show me both it and His habitation;  [26] but if he says, ‘I have no delight in you,’ behold, here I am. Let him do to me as seems good to him.”  [27] The king said also to Zadok the priest, “Aren’t you a seer? Return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.  [28] Behold, I will stay at the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.”  [29] Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried God’s ark to Jerusalem again; and they stayed there.  [30] David went up by the ascent of the Mount of Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered and went barefoot. All the people who were with him each covered his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.\n     [31] Someone told David, saying, “Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.”\n    David said, “Yahweh, please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.”\n     [32] When David had come to the top, where God was worshiped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet Him with His tunic torn and earth on His head.  [33] David said to him, “If you pass on with me, then you will be a burden to me;  [34] but if you return to the city, and tell Absalom, ‘I will be your servant, O king. As I have been your father’s servant in time past, so I will now be your servant; then will you defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.’  [35] Don’t you have Zadok and Abiathar the priests there with you? Therefore whatever you hear out of the king’s house, tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.  [36] Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son, and Jonathan, Abiathar’s son. Send to me everything that you shall hear by them.”\n     [37] So Hushai, David’s friend, came into the city; and Absalom came into Jerusalem.\n"

[2] The king said to Ziba, “What do you mean by these?”\n    Ziba said, “The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that those who are faint in the wilderness may drink.”\n     [3] The king said, “Where is your master’s son?”\n    Ziba said to the king, “Behold, he is staying in Jerusalem; for he said, ‘Today the house of Israel will restore me the kingdom of my father.’”\n     [4] Then the king said to Ziba, “Behold, all that belongs to Mephibosheth is yours.”\n    Ziba said, “I bow down. Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, O king.”\n     [5] When King David came to Bahurim, behold, a man of the family of Saul’s house came out, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera. He came out and cursed as he came.  [6] He cast stones at David and at all the servants of King David, and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.  [7] Shimei said when he cursed, “Be gone, be gone, you man of blood, and wicked fellow!  [8] Yahweh has returned on you all the blood of Saul’s house, in whose place you have reigned! Yahweh has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son! Behold, you are caught by your own mischief, because you are a man of blood!”\n     [9] Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Please let me go over and take off his head.”  [10] The king said, “What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? Because He curses, and because Yahweh has said to Him, ‘Curse David,’ who then shall say, ‘Why have you done so?’”\n     [11] David said to Abishai and to all His servants, “Behold, my son, who came out of my bowels, seeks my life. How much more this Benjamite, now? Leave Him alone, and let Him curse; for Yahweh has invited Him.  [12] It may be that Yahweh will look on the wrong done to me, and that Yahweh will repay me good for the cursing of me today.”  [13] So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hillside opposite him and cursed as he went, threw stones at him, and threw dust.  [14] The king and all the people who were with him arrived weary; and he refreshed himself there.\n     [15] Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.  [16] When Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, had come to Absalom, Hushai said to Absalom, “Long live the king! Long live the king!”\n     [17] Absalom said to Hushai, “Is this your kindness to your friend? Why didn’t you go with your friend?”\n     [18] Hushai said to Absalom, “No; but whomever Yahweh and this people and all the men of Israel have chosen, I will be His, and I will stay with Him.  [19] Again, whom should I serve? Shouldn’t I serve in the presence of his son? As I have served in your father’s presence, so I will be in your presence.”\n     [20] Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give your counsel what we shall do.”\n     [21] Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Go in to your father’s concubines that he has left to keep the house. Then all Israel will hear that you are abhorred by your father. Then the hands of all who are with you will be strong.”\n     [22] So they spread a tent for Absalom on the top of the house, and Absalom went in to his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.\n     [23] The counsel of Ahithophel, which He gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the inner sanctuary of God. All the counsel of Ahithophel was like this both with David and with Absalom.\n"

          "content": "     [1] Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Let me now choose twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David tonight.  [2] I will come on him while he is weary and exhausted, and will make him afraid. All the people who are with him will flee. I will strike the king only,  [3] and I will bring back all the people to you. The man whom you seek is as if all returned. All the people shall be in peace.”\n     [4] The saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.  [5] Then Absalom said, “Now call Hushai the Archite also, and let’s hear likewise what he says.”\n     [6] When Hushai had come to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, “Ahithophel has spoken like this. Shall we do what he says? If not, speak up.”\n     [7] Hushai said to Absalom, “The counsel that Ahithophel has given this time is not good.”  [8] Hushai said moreover, “You know your father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are fierce in their minds, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field. Your father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.  [9] Behold, he is now hidden in some pit, or in some other place. It will happen, when some of them have fallen at the first, that whoever hears it will say, ‘There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom!’  [10] Even he who is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant men.  [11] But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to you, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that you go to battle in your own person.  [12] So we will come on him in some place where he will be found, and we will light on him as the dew falls on the ground, then we will not leave so much as one of him and of all the men who are with him.  [13] Moreover, if he has gone into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there isn’t one small stone found there.”\n     [14] Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.” For Yahweh had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that Yahweh might bring evil on Absalom.\n     [15] Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, “Ahithophel counseled Absalom and the elders of Israel that way; and I have counseled this way.  [16] Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, ‘Don’t lodge tonight at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over, lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people who are with him.’”\n     [17] Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En Rogel; and a female servant used to go and report to them, and they went and told King David; for they couldn’t risk being seen coming into the city.  [18] But a boy saw them, and told Absalom. Then they both went away quickly and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down there.  [19] The woman took and spread the covering over the well’s mouth, and spread out crushed grain on it; and nothing was known.  [20] Absalom’s servants came to the woman to the house; and they said, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?”\n    The woman said to them, “They have gone over the brook of water.”\n    When they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.  [21] After they had departed, they came up out of the well and went and told King David; and they said to David, “Arise and pass quickly over the water; for thus has Ahithophel counseled against you.”\n     [22] Then David arose, and all the people who were with him, and they passed over the Jordan. By the morning light there lacked not one of them who had not gone over the Jordan.\n     [23] When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey, arose, and went home to his city, set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the tomb of his father.\n     [24] Then David came to Mahanaim. Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.  [25] Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab’s mother.  [26] Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.\n     [27] When David had come to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,  [28] brought beds, basins, earthen vessels, wheat, barley, meal, parched grain, beans, lentils, roasted grain,  [29] honey, butter, sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David and for the people who were with him to eat; for they said, “The people are hungry, weary, and thirsty in the wilderness.”\n"

[2] David sent the people out, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. The king said to the people, “I will also surely go out with you myself.”\n     [3] But the people said, “You shall not go out, for if we flee away, they will not care for us, neither if half of us die, will they care for us. But you are worth ten thousand of us. Therefore now it is better that you are ready to help us out of the city.”\n     [4] The king said to them, “I will do what seems best to you.”\n    The king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.  [5] The king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, “Deal gently for my sake with the young man Absalom.” All the people heard when the king commanded all the captains concerning Absalom.\n     [6] So the people went out into the field against Israel; and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.  [7] The people of Israel were struck there before David’s servants, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men.  [8] For the battle was there spread over the surface of all the country, and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.\n     [9] Absalom happened to meet David’s servants. Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak; and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was hanging between the sky and earth; and the mule that was under him went on.  [10] A certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, “Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.”\n     [11] Joab said to the man who told him, “Behold, you saw it, and why didn’t you strike him there to the ground? I would have given you ten pieces of silver and a sash.”\n     [12] The man said to Joab, “Though I should receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, I still wouldn’t stretch out my hand against the king’s son; for in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, ‘Beware that no one touch the young man Absalom.’  [13] Otherwise, if I had dealt falsely against his life (and there is no matter hidden from the king), then you yourself would have set yourself against me.”\n     [14] Then Joab said, “I’m not going to wait like this with you.” He took three darts in his hand and thrust them through Absalom’s heart while he was still alive in the middle of the oak.  [15] Ten young men who bore Joab’s armor surrounded and struck Absalom, and killed him.  [16] Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held the people back.  [17] They took Absalom and cast him into a great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones. Then all Israel fled, each to his own tent.\n     [18] Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar which is in the king’s valley, for he said, “I have no son to keep my name in memory.” He called the pillar after his own name. It is called Absalom’s monument, to this day.\n     [19] Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, “Let me now run and carry the king news, how Yahweh has avenged Him of His enemies.”\n     [20] Joab said to him, “You must not be the bearer of news today, but you must carry news another day. But today you must carry no news, because the king’s son is dead.”\n     [21] Then Joab said to the Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen!” The Cushite bowed himself to Joab, and ran.\n     [22] Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said yet again to Joab, “But come what may, please let me also run after the Cushite.”\n    Joab said, “Why do you want to run, my son, since you will have no reward for the news?”\n     [23] “But come what may,” he said, “I will run.”\n    He said to him, “Run!” Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain, and outran the Cushite.\n     [24] Now David was sitting between the two gates; and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate to the wall, and lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, a man running alone.  [25] The watchman shouted and told the king. The king said, “If he is alone, there is news in his mouth.” He came closer and closer.\n     [26] The watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called to the gatekeeper and said, “Behold, a man running alone!”\n    The king said, “He also brings news.”\n     [27] The watchman said, “I think the running of the first one is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.”\n    The king said, “He is a good man, and comes with good news.”\n     [28] Ahimaaz called, and said to the king, “All is well.” He bowed Himself before the king with His face to the earth, and said, “Blessed is Yahweh your God, who has delivered up the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king!”\n     [29] The king said, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?”\n    Ahimaaz answered, “When Joab sent the king’s servant, even me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I don’t know what it was.”\n     [30] The king said, “Come and stand here.” He came and stood still.\n     [31] Behold, the Cushite came. The Cushite said, “Good news for my lord the king, for Yahweh has avenged you today of all those who rose up against you.”\n     [32] The king said to the Cushite, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?”\n    The Cushite answered, “May the enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise up against you to do you harm, be as that young man is.”\n     [33] The king was much moved, and went up to the room over the gate and wept. As he went, he said, “My son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! I wish I had died instead of you, Absalom, my son, my son!”\n"

[4] The king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, “My son Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son!”\n     [5] Joab came into the house to the king, and said, “Today you have shamed the faces of all your servants who today have saved your life, and the lives of your sons and of your daughters, and the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines;  [6] in that you love those who hate you and hate those who love you. For you have declared today that princes and servants are nothing to you. For today I perceive that if Absalom had lived and we had all died today, then it would have pleased you well.  [7] Now therefore arise, go out and speak to comfort your servants; for I swear by Yahweh, if you don’t go out, not a man will stay with you this night. That would be worse to you than all the evil that has happened to you from your youth until now.”\n     [8] Then the king arose and sat in the gate. The people were all told, “Behold, the king is sitting in the gate.” All the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled every man to his tent.  [9] All the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he has fled out of the land from Absalom.  [10] Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why don’t you speak a word of bringing the king back?”\n     [11] King David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, “Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, ‘Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house, since the speech of all Israel has come to the king, to return him to his house?  [12] You are my brothers. You are my bone and my flesh. Why then are you the last to bring back the king?’  [13] Say to Amasa, ‘Aren’t you my bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if you aren’t captain of the army before me continually instead of Joab.’”  [14] He bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as one man, so that they sent to the king, saying, “Return, you and all your servants.”\n     [15] So the king returned, and came to the Jordan. Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan.  [16] Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet King David.  [17] There were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of Saul’s house, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king.  [18] A ferry boat went to bring over the king’s household, and to do what he thought good.\n    Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king when he had come over the Jordan.  [19] He said to the king, “Don’t let my lord impute iniquity to me, or remember that which your servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.  [20] For your servant knows that I have sinned. Therefore behold, I have come today as the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.”\n     [21] But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered, “Shouldn’t Shimei be put to death for this, because He cursed Yahweh’s anointed?”\n     [22] David said, “What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should be adversaries to me today? Shall any man be put to death today in Israel? For don’t I know that I am king over Israel today?”  [23] The king said to Shimei, “You will not die.” The king swore to him.\n     [24] Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither groomed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace.  [25] When he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king, the king said to him, “Why didn’t you go with me, Mephibosheth?”\n     [26] He answered, “My lord, O king, my servant deceived me. For your servant said, ‘I will saddle a donkey for myself, that I may ride on it and go with the king,’ because your servant is lame.  [27] He has slandered your servant to my lord the king, but my lord the king is as an angel of God. Therefore do what is good in your eyes.  [28] For all my father’s house were but dead men before my lord the king; yet you set your servant among those who ate at your own table. What right therefore have I yet that I should appeal any more to the king?”\n     [29] The king said to him, “Why do you speak any more of your matters? I say, you and Ziba divide the land.”\n     [30] Mephibosheth said to the king, “Yes, let him take all, because my lord the king has come in peace to his own house.”\n     [31] Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went over the Jordan with the king to conduct him over the Jordan.  [32] Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even eighty years old. He had provided the king with sustenance while he stayed at Mahanaim, for he was a very great man.  [33] The king said to Barzillai, “Come over with me, and I will sustain you with me in Jerusalem.”\n     [34] Barzillai said to the king, “How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?  [35] I am eighty years old, today. Can I discern between good and bad? Can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Can I hear the voice of singing men and singing women any more? Why then should your servant be a burden to my lord the king?  [36] Your servant will just go over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king repay me with such a reward?  [37] Please let your servant turn back again, that I may die in my own city, by the grave of my father and my mother. But behold, your servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good to you.”\n     [38] The king answered, “Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good to you. Whatever you request of me, that I will do for you.”\n     [39] All the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over. Then the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him; and he returned to his own place.  [40] So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went over with him. All the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half the people of Israel.  [41] Behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, “Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away, and brought the king and his household, over the Jordan, and all David’s men with him?”\n     [42] All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, “Because the king is a close relative to us. Why then are you angry about this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king’s cost? Or has he given us any gift?”\n     [43] The men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, “We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more claim to David than you. Why then did you despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king?” The words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.\n"

          "content": "     [1] There happened to be there a wicked fellow, whose name was Sheba the son of Bichri, a Benjamite; and he blew the trumpet, and said, “We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse. Every man to his tents, Israel!”\n     [2] So all the men of Israel went up from following David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah joined with their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.\n     [3] David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in custody and provided them with sustenance, but didn’t go in to them. So they were shut up to the day of their death, living in widowhood.\n     [4] Then the king said to Amasa, “Call me the men of Judah together within three days, and be here present.”\n     [5] So Amasa went to call the men of Judah together, but he stayed longer than the set time which had been appointed to him.  [6] David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom did. Take your lord’s servants and pursue after him, lest he get himself fortified cities, and escape out of our sight.”\n     [7] Joab’s men went out after him with the Cherethites, the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went out of Jerusalem to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.  [8] When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was clothed in his apparel of war that he had put on, and on it was a sash with a sword fastened on his waist in its sheath; and as he went along it fell out.  [9] Joab said to Amasa, “Is it well with you, my brother?” Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.  [10] But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab’s hand. So he struck him with it in the body and shed out his bowels to the ground, and didn’t strike him again; and he died. Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba the son of Bichri.  [11] One of Joab’s young men stood by him, and said, “He who favors Joab, and he who is for David, let him follow Joab!”\n     [12] Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the middle of the highway. When the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him when he saw that everyone who came by him stood still.  [13] When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.  [14] He went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, to Beth Maacah, and all the Berites. They were gathered together, and went also after him.  [15] They came and besieged him in Abel of Beth Maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart; and all the people who were with Joab battered the wall to throw it down.\n     [16] Then a wise woman cried out of the city, “Hear, hear! Please say to Joab, ‘Come near here, that I may speak with you.’”  [17] He came near to her; and the woman said, “Are you Joab?”\n    He answered, “I am.”\n    Then she said to him, “Hear the words of your servant.”\n    He answered, “I’m listening.”\n     [18] Then she spoke, saying, “They used to say in old times, ‘They shall surely ask counsel at Abel,’ and so they settled a matter.  [19] I am among those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel. You seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why will you swallow up Yahweh’s inheritance?”\n     [20] Joab answered, “Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.  [21] The matter is not so. But a man of the hill country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand against the king, even against David. Just deliver him, and I will depart from the city.”\n    The woman said to Joab, “Behold, his head will be thrown to you over the wall.”\n     [22] Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. They cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. He blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. Then Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.\n     [23] Now Joab was over all the army of Israel, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites,  [24] Adoram was over the men subject to forced labor, Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder,  [25] Sheva was scribe, Zadok and Abiathar were priests,  [26] and Ira the Jairite was chief minister to David.\n"

Yahweh said, “It is for Saul, and for His bloody house, because He put the Gibeonites to death.”\n     [2] The king called the Gibeonites and said to them (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites, and the children of Israel had sworn to them; and Saul sought to kill them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah);  [3] and David said to the Gibeonites, “What should I do for you? And with what should I make atonement, that you may bless Yahweh’s inheritance?”\n     [4] The Gibeonites said to him, “It is no matter of silver or gold between us and Saul or his house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel.”\n    He said, “I will do for you whatever you say.”\n     [5] They said to the king, “The man who consumed us and who plotted against us, that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel,  [6] let seven men of His sons be delivered to us, and we will hang them up to Yahweh in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of Yahweh.”\n    The king said, “I will give them.”\n     [7] But the king spared Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of Yahweh’s oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.  [8] But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Merab the daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite.  [9] He delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites; and they hanged them on the mountain before Yahweh, and all seven of them fell together. They were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest.\n     [10] Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it for herself on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water poured on them from the sky. She allowed neither the birds of the sky to rest on them by day, nor the animals of the field by night.  [11] David was told what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.  [12] So David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh Gilead, who had stolen them from the street of Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hanged them in the day that the Philistines killed Saul in Gilboa;  [13] and he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son. They also gathered the bones of those who were hanged.  [14] They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan His son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the tomb of Kish His father; and they performed all that the king commanded. After that, God answered prayer for the land.\n     [15] The Philistines had war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines. David grew faint;  [16] and Ishbibenob, who was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of bronze in weight, he being armed with a new sword, thought he would kill David.  [17] But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and struck the Philistine and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, “Don’t go out with us to battle any more, so that you don’t quench the lamp of Israel.”\n     [18] After this, there was again war with the Philistines at Gob. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph, who was of the sons of the giant.  [19] There was again war with the Philistines at Gob, and Elhanan the son of Jaare-Oregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite’s brother, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.  [20] There was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had six fingers on every hand and six toes on every foot, twenty-four in number, and he also was born to the giant.  [21] When he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David’s brother, killed him.  [22] These four were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.\n"

\n   [21] Yahweh rewarded me according to my righteousness.\n    He rewarded me according to the cleanness of my hands.\n   [22] For I have kept Yahweh’s ways,\n    and have not wickedly departed from

Who is a rock, besides our God?\n   [33] God is my strong fortress.\n    He makes my way perfect.\n   [34] He makes his feet like hinds’ feet,\n    and sets me on my high places.\n   [35] He teaches

[9] After him was Eleazar the son of Dodai the son of an Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines who were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel had gone away.  [10] He arose and struck the Philistines until His hand was weary, and His hand froze to the sword; and Yahweh worked a great victory that day; and the people returned after Him only to take plunder.  [11] After him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite. The Philistines had gathered together into a troop where there was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the people fled from the Philistines.  [12] But He stood in the middle of the plot and defended it, and killed the Philistines; and Yahweh worked a great victory.\n     [13] Three of the thirty chief men went down, and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam; and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.  [14] David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.  [15] David said longingly, “Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!”\n     [16] The three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David; but He would not drink of it, but poured it out to Yahweh.  [17] He said, “Be it far from me, Yahweh, that I should do this! Isn’t this the blood of the men who risked their lives to go?” Therefore He would not drink it. The three mighty men did these things.\n     [18] Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. He lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them, and had a name among the three.  [19] Wasn’t he most honorable of the three? Therefore he was made their captain. However he wasn’t included as one of the three.\n     [20] Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in the middle of a pit in a time of snow.  [21] He killed a huge Egyptian, and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and killed him with his own spear.  [22] Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did these things, and had a name among the three mighty men.  [23] He was more honorable than the thirty, but he didn’t attain to the three. David set him over his guard.\n     [24] Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty: Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,  [25] Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,  [26] Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,  [27] Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,  [28] Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,  [29] Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,  [30] Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash.

But why does my lord the king delight in this thing?”\n     [4] Notwithstanding, the king’s word prevailed against Joab and against the captains of the army. Joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the king to count the people of Israel.  [5] They passed over the Jordan and encamped in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and to Jazer;  [6] then they came to Gilead and to the land of Tahtim Hodshi; and they came to Dan Jaan and around to Sidon,  [7] and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites and of the Canaanites; and they went out to the south of Judah, at Beersheba.  [8] So when they had gone back and forth through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.  [9] Joab gave up the sum of the counting of the people to the king; and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword, and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.\n     [10] David’s heart struck Him after He had counted the people. David said to Yahweh, “I have sinned greatly in that which I have done. But now, Yahweh, put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.”\n     [11] When David rose up in the morning, Yahweh’s word came to the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying,  [12] “Go and speak to David, ‘Yahweh says, “I offer you three things. Choose one of them, that I may do it to you.”’”\n     [13] So Gad came to David, and told him, saying, “Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? Or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days’ pestilence in your land? Now answer, and consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.”\n     [14] David said to Gad, “I am in distress. Let us fall now into Yahweh’s hand, for His mercies are great. Let me not fall into man’s hand.”\n     [15] So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning even to the appointed time; and seventy thousand men died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba.  [16] When the angel stretched out His hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, Yahweh relented of the disaster, and said to the angel who destroyed the people, “It is enough. Now withdraw your hand.” Yahweh’s angel was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.\n     [17] David spoke to Yahweh when He saw the angel who struck the people, and said, “Behold, I have sinned, and I have done perversely; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand be against me, and against my father’s house.”\n     [18] Gad came that day to David and said to Him, “Go up, build an altar to Yahweh on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.”\n     [19] David went up according to the saying of Gad, as Yahweh commanded.  [20] Araunah looked out, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him. Then Araunah went out and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.  [21] Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to His servant?”\n    David said, “To buy your threshing floor, to build an altar to Yahweh, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people.”\n     [22] Araunah said to David, “Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him. Behold, the cattle for the burnt offering, and the threshing sledges and the yokes of the oxen for the wood.  [23] All this, O king, does Araunah give to the king.” Araunah said to the king, “May Yahweh your God accept you.”\n     [24] The king said to Araunah, “No, but I will most certainly buy it from you for a price. I will not offer burnt offerings to Yahweh my God which cost me nothing.” So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.  [25] David built an altar to Yahweh there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So Yahweh was entreated for the land, and the plague was removed from Israel.\n"

          "content": "     [1] Now King David was old and advanced in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he couldn’t keep warm.  [2] Therefore his servants said to him, “Let a young virgin be sought for my lord the king. Let her stand before the king, and cherish him; and let her lie in your bosom, that my lord the king may keep warm.”  [3] So they sought for a beautiful young lady throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.  [4] The young lady was very beautiful; and she cherished the king, and served him; but the king didn’t know her intimately.\n     [5] Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, “I will be king.” Then he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.  [6] His father had not displeased him at any time in saying, “Why have you done so?” and he was also a very handsome man; and he was born after Absalom.  [7] He conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest; and they followed Adonijah and helped him.  [8] But Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.\n     [9] Adonijah killed sheep, cattle, and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En Rogel; and he called all his brothers, the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah, the king’s servants;  [10] but he didn’t call Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother.\n     [11] Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, “Haven’t you heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith reigns, and David our lord doesn’t know it?  [12] Now therefore come, please let me give you counsel, that you may save your own life and your son Solomon’s life.  [13] Go in to King David, and tell him, ‘Didn’t you, my lord the king, swear to your servant, saying, “Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?” Why then does Adonijah reign?’  [14] Behold, while you are still talking there with the king, I will also come in after you and confirm your words.”\n     [15] Bathsheba went in to the king in his room. The king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite was serving the king.  [16] Bathsheba bowed and showed respect to the king. The king said, “What would you like?”\n     [17] She said to Him, “My lord, you swore by Yahweh your God to your servant, ‘Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and He shall sit on my throne.’  [18] Now, behold, Adonijah reigns; and you, my lord the king, don’t know it.  [19] He has slain cattle and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the sons of the king, Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the army; but he hasn’t called Solomon your servant.  [20] You, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, that you should tell them who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.  [21] Otherwise it will happen, when my lord the king sleeps with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be considered criminals.”\n     [22] Behold, while she was still talking with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.  [23] They told the king, saying, “Behold, Nathan the prophet!”\n    When he had come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.  [24] Nathan said, “My lord, King, have you said, ‘Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?’  [25] For he has gone down today, and has slain cattle, fatlings, and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king’s sons, the captains of the army, and Abiathar the priest. Behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and saying, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’  [26] But he hasn’t called me, even me your servant, Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon.  [27] Was this thing done by my lord the king, and you haven’t shown to your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?”\n     [28] Then King David answered, “Call Bathsheba in to me.” She came into the king’s presence and stood before the king.  [29] The king vowed and said, “As Yahweh lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,  [30] most certainly as I swore to you by Yahweh, the God of Israel, saying, ‘Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and He shall sit on my throne in my place;’ I will most certainly do this today.”\n     [31] Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth and showed respect to the king, and said, “Let my lord King David live forever!”\n     [32] King David said, “Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.” They came before the king.  [33] The king said to them, “Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon.  [34] Let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel. Blow the trumpet, and say, ‘Long live King Solomon!’  [35] Then come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne; for he shall be king in my place. I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah.”\n     [36] Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, “Amen. May Yahweh, the God of my lord the king, say so.  [37] As Yahweh has been with my lord the king, even so may He be with Solomon, and make His throne greater than the throne of my lord King David.”\n     [38] So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on King David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon.  [39] Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the Tent, and anointed Solomon. They blew the trumpet; and all the people said, “Long live King Solomon!”\n     [40] All the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth shook with their sound.  [41] Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they had finished eating. When Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, “Why is this noise of the city being in an uproar?”\n     [42] While he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said, “Come in; for you are a worthy man, and bring good news.”\n     [43] Jonathan answered Adonijah, “Most certainly our lord King David has made Solomon king.  [44] The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they have caused him to ride on the king’s mule.  [45] Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon. They have come up from there rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that you have heard.  [46] Also, Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom.  [47] Moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord King David, saying, ‘May your God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and make His throne greater than your throne;’ and the king bowed Himself on the bed.  [48] Also thus said the king, ‘Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who has given one to sit on my throne today, my eyes even seeing it.’”\n     [49] All the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and each man went his way.  [50] Adonijah was afraid because of Solomon; and he arose, and went, and hung onto the horns of the altar.  [51] Solomon was told, “Behold, Adonijah fears King Solomon; for, behold, he is hanging onto the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let King Solomon swear to me first that he will not kill his servant with the sword.’”\n     [52] Solomon said, “If he shows himself a worthy man, not a hair of his shall fall to the earth; but if wickedness is found in him, he shall die.”\n     [53] So King Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. He came and bowed down to King Solomon; and Solomon said to him, “Go to your house.”\n"

          "content": "     [1] Now the days of David came near that he should die; and he commanded Solomon his son, saying,  [2] “I am going the way of all the earth. You be strong therefore, and show yourself a man;  [3] and keep the instruction of Yahweh your God, to walk in His ways, to keep His statutes, His commandments, His ordinances, and His testimonies, according to that which is written in the law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn yourself.  [4] Then Yahweh may establish His word which He spoke concerning me, saying, ‘If your children are careful of their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail you,’ He said, ‘a man on the throne of Israel.’\n     [5] “Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, even what he did to the two captains of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he killed, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war on his sash that was around his waist and in his sandals that were on his feet.  [6] Do therefore according to your wisdom, and don’t let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace.  [7] But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be among those who eat at your table; for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom your brother.\n     [8] “Behold, there is with you Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim; but He came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to Him by Yahweh, saying, ‘I will not put you to death with the sword.’  [9] Now therefore don’t hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man; and you will know what you ought to do to him, and you shall bring his gray head down to Sheol with blood.”\n     [10] David slept with his fathers, and was buried in David’s city.  [11] The days that David reigned over Israel were forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem.  [12] Solomon sat on David his father’s throne; and his kingdom was firmly established.\n     [13] Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. She said, “Do you come peaceably?”\n    He said, “Peaceably.  [14] He said moreover, I have something to tell you.”\n    She said, “Say on.”\n     [15] He said, “You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign. However, the kingdom is turned around, and has become my brother’s; for it was His from Yahweh.  [16] Now I ask one petition of you. Don’t deny me.”\n    She said to him, “Say on.”\n     [17] He said, “Please speak to Solomon the king (for he will not tell you ‘no’), that he give me Abishag the Shunammite as wife.”\n     [18] Bathsheba said, “All right. I will speak for you to the king.”\n     [19] Bathsheba therefore went to King Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. The king rose up to meet her and bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne and caused a throne to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand.  [20] Then she said, “I ask one small petition of you; don’t deny me.”\n    The king said to her, “Ask on, my mother, for I will not deny you.”\n     [21] She said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as wife.”\n     [22] King Solomon answered his mother, “Why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also, for he is my elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.”  [23] Then King Solomon swore by Yahweh, saying, “God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against His own life.  [24] Now therefore as Yahweh lives, who has established me and set me on my father David’s throne, and who has made me a house as He promised, surely Adonijah shall be put to death today.”\n     [25] King Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell on him, so that he died.  [26] To Abiathar the priest the king said, “Go to Anathoth, to your own fields, for you are worthy of death. But I will not at this time put you to death, because you bore the Lord Yahweh’s ark before David my father, and because you were afflicted in all in which my father was afflicted.”  [27] So Solomon thrust Abiathar out from being priest to Yahweh, that He might fulfill Yahweh’s word which He spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.\n     [28] This news came to Joab; for Joab had followed Adonijah, although He didn’t follow Absalom. Joab fled to Yahweh’s Tent, and held onto the horns of the altar.  [29] King Solomon was told, “Joab has fled to Yahweh’s Tent; and behold, He is by the altar.” Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, “Go, fall on Him.”\n     [30] Benaiah came to Yahweh’s Tent, and said to Him, “The king says, ‘Come out!’”\n    He said, “No; but I will die here.”\n    Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, “This is what Joab said, and this is how He answered me.”\n     [31] The king said to him, “Do as he has said, and fall on him, and bury him, that you may take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father’s house.  [32] Yahweh will return His blood on His own head, because He fell on two men more righteous and better than He, and killed them with the sword, and my father David didn’t know it: Abner the son of Ner, captain of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the army of Judah.  [33] So their blood will return on the head of Joab and on the head of His offspring forever. But for David, for His offspring, for His house, and for His throne, there will be peace forever from Yahweh.”\n     [34] Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and fell on him, and killed him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.  [35] The king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army; and the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar.\n     [36] The king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem, and live there, and don’t go anywhere else.  [37] For on the day you go out and pass over the brook Kidron, know for certain that you will surely die. Your blood will be on your own head.”\n     [38] Shimei said to the king, “What you say is good. As my lord the king has said, so will your servant do.” Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days.\n     [39] At the end of three years, two of Shimei’s slaves ran away to Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. They told Shimei, saying, “Behold, your slaves are in Gath.”\n     [40] Shimei arose, saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his slaves; and Shimei went and brought his slaves from Gath.  [41] Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had come again.\n     [42] The king sent and called for Shimei, and said to Him, “Didn’t I adjure you by Yahweh and warn you, saying, ‘Know for certain that on the day you go out and walk anywhere else, you shall surely die?’ You said to me, ‘The saying that I have heard is good.’  [43] Why then have you not kept the oath of Yahweh and the commandment that I have instructed you with?”  [44] The king said moreover to Shimei, “You know in your heart all the wickedness that you did to David my father. Therefore Yahweh will return your wickedness on your own head.  [45] But King Solomon will be blessed, and David’s throne will be established before Yahweh forever.”  [46] So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out, and fell on him, so that he died. The kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.\n"

He took Pharaoh’s daughter and brought her into David’s city until He had finished building His own house, Yahweh’s house, and the wall around Jerusalem.  [2] However, the people sacrificed in the high places, because there was not yet a house built for Yahweh’s name.  [3] Solomon loved Yahweh, walking in the statutes of David His father, except that He sacrificed and burned incense in the high places.  [4] The king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the great high place. Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.  [5] In Gibeon, Yahweh appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, “Ask for what I should give you.”\n     [6] Solomon said, “You have shown to your servant David my father great loving kindness, because he walked before you in truth, in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with you. You have kept for him this great loving kindness, that you have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is today.  [7] Now, Yahweh my God, you have made your servant king instead of David my father. I am just a little child. I don’t know how to go out or come in.  [8] Your servant is among your people which you have chosen, a great people, that can’t be numbered or counted for multitude.  [9] Give your servant therefore an understanding heart to judge your people, that I may discern between good and evil; for who is able to judge this great people of yours?”\n     [10] This request pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.  [11] God said to Him, “Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked for yourself long life, nor have you asked for riches for yourself, nor have you asked for the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice,  [12] behold, I have done according to your word. Behold, I have given you a wise and understanding heart, so that there has been no one like you before you, and after you none will arise like you.  [13] I have also given you that which you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that there will not be any among the kings like you for all your days.  [14] If you will walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your days.”\n     [15] Solomon awoke; and behold, it was a dream. Then He came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, and offered up burnt offerings, offered peace offerings, and made a feast for all His servants.\n     [16] Then two women who were prostitutes came to the king, and stood before him.  [17] The one woman said, “Oh, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house. I delivered a child with her in the house.  [18] The third day after I delivered, this woman delivered also. We were together. There was no stranger with us in the house, just us two in the house.  [19] This woman’s child died in the night, because she lay on it.  [20] She arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me while your servant slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.  [21] When I rose in the morning to nurse my child, behold, he was dead; but when I had looked at him in the morning, behold, it was not my son whom I bore.”\n     [22] The other woman said, “No! But the living one is my son, and the dead one is your son.”\n    The first one said, “No! But the dead one is your son, and the living one is my son.” They argued like this before the king.\n     [23] Then the king said, “One says, ‘This is my son who lives, and your son is the dead;’ and the other says, ‘No! But your son is the dead one, and my son is the living one.’”\n     [24] The king said, “Get me a sword.” So they brought a sword before the king.\n     [25] The king said, “Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.”\n     [26] Then the woman whose the living child was spoke to the king, for her heart yearned over her son, and she said, “Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and in no way kill him!”\n    But the other said, “He shall be neither mine nor yours. Divide him.”\n     [27] Then the king answered, “Give the first woman the living child, and definitely do not kill him. She is his mother.”\n     [28] All Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in Him to do justice.\n"

[2] These were the princes whom he had: Azariah the son of Zadok, the priest;  [3] Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder;  [4] Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the army; Zadok and Abiathar were priests;  [5] Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers; Zabud the son of Nathan was chief minister, the king’s friend;  [6] Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the men subject to forced labor.\n     [7] Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided food for the king and his household. Each man had to make provision for a month in the year.  [8] These are their names: Ben Hur, in the hill country of Ephraim;  [9] Ben Deker, in Makaz, in Shaalbim, Beth Shemesh, and Elon Beth Hanan;  [10] Ben Hesed, in Arubboth (Socoh and all the land of Hepher belonged to him);  [11] Ben Abinadab, in all the height of Dor (he had Taphath, Solomon’s daughter, as wife);  [12] Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth Shean which is beside Zarethan, beneath Jezreel, from Beth Shean to Abel Meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam;  [13] Ben Geber, in Ramoth Gilead (the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead, belonged to him; and the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars, belonged to him);  [14] Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;  [15] Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon as wife);  [16] Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth;  [17] Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar;  [18] Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin;  [19] Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer who was in the land.\n     [20] Judah and Israel were numerous as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry.  [21] Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt. They brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life.  [22] Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty cors of fine flour, sixty measures of meal,  [23] ten head of fat cattle, twenty head of cattle out of the pastures, and one hundred sheep, in addition to deer, gazelles, roebucks, and fattened fowl.  [24] For he had dominion over all on this side the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side the River; and he had peace on all sides around him.  [25] Judah and Israel lived safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.  [26] Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.  [27] Those officers provided food for King Solomon, and for all who came to King Solomon’s table, every man in his month. They let nothing be lacking.  [28] They also brought barley and straw for the horses and swift steeds to the place where the officers were, each man according to his duty.  [29] God gave Solomon abundant wisdom, understanding, and breadth of mind like the sand that is on the seashore.  [30] Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east and all the wisdom of Egypt.  [31] For he was wiser than all men—wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol; and his fame was in all the nations all around.  [32] He spoke three thousand proverbs, and his songs numbered one thousand five.  [33] He spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that grows out of the wall; he also spoke of animals, of birds, of creeping things, and of fish.  [34] People of all nations came to hear the wisdom of Solomon, sent by all kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom.\n"

[2] Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,  [3] “You know that David my father could not build a house for the name of Yahweh His God because of the wars which were around Him on every side, until Yahweh put His enemies under the soles of His feet.  [4] But now Yahweh my God has given me rest on every side. There is no enemy and no evil occurrence.  [5] Behold, I intend to build a house for the name of Yahweh my God, as Yahweh spoke to David my father, saying, ‘Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place shall build the house for my name.’  [6] Now therefore command that cedar trees be cut for me out of Lebanon. My servants will be with your servants; and I will give you wages for your servants according to all that you say. For you know that there is nobody among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians.”\n     [7] When Hiram heard the words of Solomon, He rejoiced greatly, and said, “Blessed is Yahweh today, who has given to David a wise son to rule over this great people.”  [8] Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, “I have heard the message which you have sent to me. I will do all your desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning cypress timber.  [9] My servants will bring them down from Lebanon to the sea. I will make them into rafts to go by sea to the place that you specify to me, and will cause them to be broken up there, and you will receive them. You will accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.”\n     [10] So Hiram gave Solomon cedar timber and cypress timber according to all his desire.  [11] Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand cors of wheat for food to his household, and twenty cors of pure oil. Solomon gave this to Hiram year by year.  [12] Yahweh gave Solomon wisdom, as He promised Him. There was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty together.\n     [13] King Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.  [14] He sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: for a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home; and Adoniram was over the men subject to forced labor.  [15] Solomon had seventy thousand who bore burdens, and eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains,  [16] besides Solomon’s chief officers who were over the work: three thousand three hundred who ruled over the people who labored in the work.  [17] The king commanded, and they cut out large stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with worked stone.  [18] Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders and the Gebalites cut them, and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house.\n"

          "content": "     [1] In the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month, He began to build Yahweh’s house.  [2] The house which King Solomon built for Yahweh had a length of sixty cubits, and its width twenty, and its height thirty cubits.  [3] The porch in front of the temple of the house had a length of twenty cubits, which was along the width of the house. Ten cubits was its width in front of the house.  [4] He made windows of fixed lattice work for the house.  [5] Against the wall of the house, he built floors all around, against the walls of the house all around, both of the temple and of the inner sanctuary; and he made side rooms all around.  [6] The lowest floor was five cubits wide, and the middle was six cubits wide, and the third was seven cubits wide; for on the outside he made offsets in the wall of the house all around, that the beams should not be inserted into the walls of the house.  [7] The house, when it was under construction, was built of stone prepared at the quarry; and no hammer or ax or any tool of iron was heard in the house while it was under construction.  [8] The door for the middle side rooms was in the right side of the house. They went up by winding stairs into the middle floor, and out of the middle into the third.  [9] So he built the house and finished it; and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar.  [10] He built the floors all along the house, each five cubits high; and they rested on the house with timbers of cedar.\n     [11] Yahweh’s word came to Solomon, saying,  [12] “Concerning this house which you are building, if you will walk in my statutes, and execute my ordinances, and keep all my commandments to walk in them, then I will establish my word with you, which I spoke to David your father.  [13] I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.”\n     [14] So Solomon built the house and finished it.  [15] He built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar; from the floor of the house to the walls of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood. He covered the floor of the house with cypress boards.  [16] He built twenty cubits of the back part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the ceiling. He built this within, for an inner sanctuary, even for the most holy place.  [17] In front of the temple sanctuary was forty cubits long.  [18] There was cedar on the house within, carved with buds and open flowers. All was cedar. No stone was visible.  [19] He prepared an inner sanctuary in the middle of the house within, to set the ark of Yahweh’s covenant there.  [20] Within the inner sanctuary was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in width, and twenty cubits in its height. He overlaid it with pure gold. He covered the altar with cedar.  [21] So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold. He drew chains of gold across before the inner sanctuary, and he overlaid it with gold.  [22] He overlaid the whole house with gold, until all the house was finished. He also overlaid the whole altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary with gold.\n     [23] In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim of olive wood, each ten cubits high.  [24] Five cubits was the length of one wing of the cherub, and five cubits was the length of the other wing of the cherub. From the tip of one wing to the tip of the other was ten cubits.  [25] The other cherub was ten cubits. Both the cherubim were of one measure and one form.  [26] One cherub was ten cubits high, and so was the other cherub.  [27] He set the cherubim within the inner house. The wings of the cherubim were stretched out, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the middle of the house.  [28] He overlaid the cherubim with gold.\n     [29] He carved all the walls of the house around with carved figures of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, inside and outside.  [30] He overlaid the floor of the house with gold, inside and outside.  [31] For the entrance of the inner sanctuary, he made doors of olive wood. The lintel and door posts were a fifth part of the wall.  [32] So he made two doors of olive wood; and he carved on them carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold. He spread the gold on the cherubim and on the palm trees.  [33] He also made the entrance of the temple door posts of olive wood, out of a fourth part of the wall,  [34] and two doors of cypress wood. The two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.  [35] He carved cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold fitted on the engraved work.  [36] He built the inner court with three courses of cut stone and a course of cedar beams.\n     [37] The foundation of Yahweh’s house was laid in the fourth year, in the month Ziv.  [38] In the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished throughout all its parts and according to all its specifications. So he spent seven years building it.\n"

          "content": "     [1] Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.  [2] For he built the House of the Forest of Lebanon. Its length was one hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits, on four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams on the pillars.  [3] It was covered with cedar above over the forty-five beams that were on the pillars, fifteen in a row.  [4] There were beams in three rows, and window was facing window in three ranks.  [5] All the doors and posts were made square with beams; and window was facing window in three ranks.  [6] He made the hall of pillars. Its length was fifty cubits and its width thirty cubits, with a porch before them, and pillars and a threshold before them.  [7] He made the porch of the throne where he was to judge, even the porch of judgment; and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor.  [8] His house where he was to dwell, the other court within the porch, was of the same construction. He made also a house for Pharaoh’s daughter (whom Solomon had taken as wife), like this porch.  [9] All these were of costly stones, even of stone cut according to measure, sawed with saws, inside and outside, even from the foundation to the coping, and so on the outside to the great court.  [10] The foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits.  [11] Above were costly stones, even cut stone, according to measure, and cedar wood.  [12] The great court around had three courses of cut stone with a course of cedar beams, like the inner court of Yahweh’s house and the porch of the house.\n     [13] King Solomon sent and brought Hiram out of Tyre.  [14] He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in bronze; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill to work all works in bronze. He came to King Solomon and performed all his work.  [15] For he fashioned the two pillars of bronze, eighteen cubits high apiece; and a line of twelve cubits encircled either of them.  [16] He made two capitals of molten bronze to set on the tops of the pillars. The height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.  [17] There were nets of checker work and wreaths of chain work for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars: seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.  [18] So he made the pillars; and there were two rows of pomegranates around the one network, to cover the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; and he did so for the other capital.  [19] The capitals that were on the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily work, four cubits.  [20] There were capitals above also on the two pillars, close by the belly which was beside the network. There were two hundred pomegranates in rows around the other capital.  [21] He set up the pillars at the porch of the temple. He set up the right pillar and called its name Jachin; and he set up the left pillar and called its name Boaz.  [22] On the tops of the pillars was lily work. So the work of the pillars was finished.\n     [23] He made the molten sea ten cubits from brim to brim, round in shape. Its height was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits encircled it.  [24] Under its brim around there were buds which encircled it for ten cubits, encircling the sea. The buds were in two rows, cast when it was cast.  [25] It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set on them above, and all their hindquarters were inward.  [26] It was a hand width thick. Its brim was worked like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It held two thousand baths.\n     [27] He made the ten bases of bronze. The length of one base was four cubits, four cubits its width, and three cubits its height.  [28] The work of the bases was like this: they had panels; and there were panels between the ledges;  [29] and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and on the ledges there was a pedestal above; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.  [30] Every base had four bronze wheels and axles of bronze; and its four feet had supports. The supports were cast beneath the basin, with wreaths at the side of each.  [31] Its opening within the capital and above was a cubit. Its opening was round like the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also on its opening were engravings, and their panels were square, not round.  [32] The four wheels were underneath the panels; and the axles of the wheels were in the base. The height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.  [33] The work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel. Their axles, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs were all of cast metal.  [34] There were four supports at the four corners of each base. Its supports were of the base itself.  [35] In the top of the base there was a round band half a cubit high; and on the top of the base its supports and its panels were the same.  [36] On the plates of its supports and on its panels, he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, each in its space, with wreaths all around.  [37] He made the ten bases in this way: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form.  [38] He made ten basins of bronze. One basin contained forty baths. Every basin measured four cubits. One basin was on every one of the ten bases.  [39] He set the bases, five on the right side of the house and five on the left side of the house. He set the sea on the right side of the house eastward and toward the south.\n     [40] Hiram made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram finished doing all the work that He worked for King Solomon in Yahweh’s house:  [41] the two pillars; the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars;  [42] the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars;  [43] the ten bases; the ten basins on the bases;  [44] the one sea; the twelve oxen under the sea;  [45] the pots; the shovels; and the basins. All of these vessels, which Hiram made for King Solomon in Yahweh’s house, were of burnished bronze.  [46] The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.  [47] Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because there were so many of them. The weight of the bronze could not be determined.\n     [48] Solomon made all the vessels that were in Yahweh’s house: the golden altar and the table that the show bread was on, of gold;  [49] and the lamp stands, five on the right side and five on the left, in front of the inner sanctuary, of pure gold; and the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of gold;  [50] the cups, the snuffers, the basins, the spoons, and the fire pans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, of the temple, of gold.\n     [51] Thus all the work that King Solomon did in Yahweh’s house was finished. Solomon brought in the things which David His father had dedicated—the silver, the gold, and the vessels—and put them in the treasuries of Yahweh’s house.\n"

          "content": "     [1] Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel with all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers’ households of the children of Israel, to King Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Yahweh’s covenant out of David’s city, which is Zion.  [2] All the men of Israel assembled themselves to King Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.  [3] All the elders of Israel came, and the priests picked up the ark.  [4] They brought up Yahweh’s ark, the Tent of Meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent. The priests and the Levites brought these up.  [5] King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who were assembled to him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and cattle that could not be counted or numbered for multitude.  [6] The priests brought in the ark of Yahweh’s covenant to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the house, to the most holy place, even under the cherubim’s wings.  [7] For the cherubim spread their wings out over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its poles above.  [8] The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the holy place before the inner sanctuary, but they were not seen outside. They are there to this day.  [9] There was nothing in the ark except the two stone tablets which Moses put there at Horeb, when Yahweh made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.  [10] It came to pass, when the priests had come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled Yahweh’s house,  [11] so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for Yahweh’s glory filled Yahweh’s house.\n     [12] Then Solomon said, “Yahweh has said that He would dwell in the thick darkness.  [13] I have surely built you a house of habitation, a place for you to dwell in forever.”\n     [14] The king turned his face around and blessed all the assembly of Israel; and all the assembly of Israel stood.  [15] He said, “Blessed is Yahweh, the God of Israel, who spoke with His mouth to David your father, and has with His hand fulfilled it, saying,  [16] ‘Since the day that I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.’\n     [17] “Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.  [18] But Yahweh said to David my father, ‘Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart.  [19] Nevertheless, you shall not build the house; but your son who shall come out of your body, he shall build the house for my name.’  [20] Yahweh has established His word that He spoke; for I have risen up in the place of David my father, and I sit on the throne of Israel, as Yahweh promised, and have built the house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.  [21] There I have set a place for the ark, in which is Yahweh’s covenant, which He made with our fathers when He brought them out of the land of Egypt.”\n     [22] Solomon stood before Yahweh’s altar in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread out His hands toward heaven;  [23] and He said, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven above, or on earth beneath; who keeps covenant and loving kindness with your servants who walk before you with all their heart;  [24] who has kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him. Yes, you spoke with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is today.  [25] Now therefore, may Yahweh, the God of Israel, keep with your servant David my father that which you have promised Him, saying, ‘There shall not fail from you a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your children take heed to their way, to walk before me as you have walked before me.’\n     [26] “Now therefore, God of Israel, please let your word be verified, which you spoke to your servant David my father.  [27] But will God in very deed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens can’t contain you; how much less this house that I have built!  [28] Yet have respect for the prayer of your servant and for His supplication, Yahweh my God, to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you today;  [29] that your eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which you have said, ‘My name shall be there;’ to listen to the prayer which your servant prays toward this place.  [30] Listen to the supplication of your servant, and of your people Israel, when they pray toward this place. Yes, hear in heaven, your dwelling place; and when you hear, forgive.\n     [31] “If a man sins against his neighbor, and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear, and he comes and swears before your altar in this house,  [32] then hear in heaven, and act, and judge your servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way on his own head, and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.\n     [33] “When your people Israel are struck down before the enemy because they have sinned against you, if they turn again to you and confess your name, and pray and make supplication to you in this house,  [34] then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again to the land which you gave to their fathers.\n     [35] “When the sky is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against you, if they pray toward this place and confess your name, and turn from their sin when you afflict them,  [36] then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants, and of your people Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk; and send rain on your land which you have given to your people for an inheritance.\n     [37] “If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence, if there is blight, mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemy besieges them in the land of their cities, whatever plague, whatever sickness there is,  [38] whatever prayer and supplication is made by any man, or by all your people Israel, who shall each know the plague of his own heart, and spread out his hands toward this house,  [39] then hear in heaven, your dwelling place, and forgive, and act, and give to every man according to all his ways, whose heart you know (for you, even you only, know the hearts of all the children of men);  [40] that they may fear you all the days that they live in the land which you gave to our fathers.\n     [41] “Moreover, concerning the foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, when he comes out of a far country for your name’s sake  [42] (for they shall hear of your great name and of your mighty hand and of your outstretched arm), when he comes and prays toward this house,  [43] hear in heaven, your dwelling place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to you for; that all the peoples of the earth may know your name, to fear you, as do your people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by your name.\n     [44] “If your people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatever way you shall send them, and they pray to Yahweh toward the city which you have chosen, and toward the house which I have built for your name,  [45] then hear in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.  [46] If they sin against you (for there is no man who doesn’t sin), and you are angry with them and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive to the land of the enemy, far off or near;  [47] yet if they repent in the land where they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication to you in the land of those who carried them captive, saying, ‘We have sinned and have done perversely; we have dealt wickedly,’  [48] if they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies who carried them captive, and pray to you toward their land which you gave to their fathers, the city which you have chosen and the house which I have built for your name,  [49] then hear their prayer and their supplication in heaven, your dwelling place, and maintain their cause;  [50] and forgive your people who have sinned against you, and all their transgressions in which they have transgressed against you; and give them compassion before those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them  [51] (for they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought out of Egypt, from the middle of the iron furnace);  [52] that your eyes may be open to the supplication of your servant and to the supplication of your people Israel, to listen to them whenever they cry to you.  [53] For you separated them from among all the peoples of the earth to be your inheritance, as you spoke by Moses your servant, when you brought our fathers out of Egypt, Lord Yahweh.”\n     [54] It was so, that when Solomon had finished praying all this prayer and supplication to Yahweh, He arose from before Yahweh’s altar, from kneeling on His knees with His hands spread out toward heaven.  [55] He stood and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying,  [56] “Blessed be Yahweh, who has given rest to His people Israel, according to all that He promised. There has not failed one word of all His good promise, which He promised by Moses His servant.  [57] May Yahweh our God be with us as He was with our fathers. Let Him not leave us or forsake us,  [58] that he may incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, his statutes, and his ordinances, which he commanded our fathers.  [59] Let these my words, with which I have made supplication before Yahweh, be near to Yahweh our God day and night, that He may maintain the cause of His servant and the cause of His people Israel, as every day requires;  [60] that all the peoples of the earth may know that Yahweh Himself is God. There is no one else.\n     [61] “Let your heart therefore be perfect with Yahweh our God, to walk in His statutes, and to keep His commandments, as it is today.”\n     [62] The king, and all Israel with Him, offered sacrifice before Yahweh.  [63] Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings, which He offered to Yahweh, twenty two thousand head of cattle and one hundred twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated Yahweh’s house.  [64] The same day the king made the middle of the court holy that was before Yahweh’s house; for there He offered the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was before Yahweh was too little to receive the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings.\n     [65] So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with Him, a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt, before Yahweh our God, seven days and seven more days, even fourteen days.  [66] On the eighth day He sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad in their hearts for all the goodness that Yahweh had shown to David His servant, and to Israel His people.\n"

          "content": "     [1] When Solomon had finished the building of Yahweh’s house, the king’s house, and all Solomon’s desire which He was pleased to do,  [2] Yahweh appeared to Solomon the second time, as He had appeared to Him at Gibeon.  [3] Yahweh said to Him, “I have heard your prayer and your supplication that you have made before me. I have made this house holy, which you have built, to put my name there forever; and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.  [4] As for you, if you will walk before me as David your father walked, in integrity of heart and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded you, and will keep my statutes and my ordinances,  [5] then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, as I promised to David your father, saying, ‘There shall not fail from you a man on the throne of Israel.’  [6] But if you turn away from following me, you or your children, and not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods and worship them,  [7] then I will cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and I will cast this house, which I have made holy for my name, out of my sight; and Israel will be a proverb and a byword among all peoples.  [8] Though this house is so high, yet everyone who passes by it will be astonished and hiss; and they will say, ‘Why has Yahweh done this to this land and to this house?’  [9] and they will answer, ‘Because they abandoned Yahweh their God, who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and embraced other gods, and worshiped them, and served them. Therefore Yahweh has brought all this evil on them.’”\n     [10] At the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the two houses, Yahweh’s house and the king’s house  [11] (now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and cypress trees, and with gold, according to all his desire), King Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.  [12] Hiram came out of Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they didn’t please him.  [13] He said, “What cities are these which you have given me, my brother?” He called them the land of Cabul to this day.  [14] Hiram sent to the king one hundred twenty talents of gold.\n     [15] This is the reason of the forced labor which King Solomon conscripted: to build Yahweh’s house, His own house, Millo, Jerusalem’s wall, Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer.  [16] Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, taken Gezer, burned it with fire, killed the Canaanites who lived in the city, and given it for a wedding gift to his daughter, Solomon’s wife.  [17] Solomon built in the land Gezer, Beth Horon the lower,  [18] Baalath, Tamar in the wilderness,  [19] all the storage cities that Solomon had, the cities for his chariots, the cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.  [20] As for all the people who were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel—  [21] their children who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy—of them Solomon raised a levy of bondservants to this day.  [22] But of the children of Israel Solomon made no bondservants; but they were the men of war, his servants, his princes, his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.  [23] These were the five hundred fifty chief officers who were over Solomon’s work, who ruled over the people who labored in the work.\n     [24] But Pharaoh’s daughter came up out of David’s city to her house which Solomon had built for her. Then he built Millo.\n     [25] Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which He built to Yahweh three times per year, burning incense with them on the altar that was before Yahweh. So He finished the house.\n     [26] King Solomon made a fleet of ships in Ezion Geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.  [27] Hiram sent in the fleet his servants, sailors who had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.  [28] They came to Ophir, and fetched from there gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to King Solomon.\n"

          "content": "     [1] When the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning Yahweh’s name, she came to test Him with hard questions.  [2] She came to Jerusalem with a very great caravan, with camels that bore spices, very much gold, and precious stones; and when she had come to Solomon, she talked with him about all that was in her heart.  [3] Solomon answered all her questions. There wasn’t anything hidden from the king which he didn’t tell her.  [4] When the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built,  [5] the food of His table, the sitting of His servants, the attendance of His officials, their clothing, His cup bearers, and His ascent by which He went up to Yahweh’s house, there was no more spirit in her.  [6] She said to the king, “It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts and of your wisdom.  [7] However, I didn’t believe the words until I came and my eyes had seen it. Behold, not even half was told me! Your wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard.  [8] Happy are your men, happy are these your servants who stand continually before you, who hear your wisdom.  [9] Blessed is Yahweh your God, who delighted in you, to set you on the throne of Israel. Because Yahweh loved Israel forever, therefore He made you king, to do justice and righteousness.”  [10] She gave the king one hundred twenty talents of gold, and a very great quantity of spices, and precious stones. Never again was there such an abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.\n     [11] The fleet of Hiram that brought gold from Ophir also brought in from Ophir great quantities of almug trees and precious stones.  [12] The king made of the almug trees pillars for Yahweh’s house and for the king’s house, harps also and stringed instruments for the singers; no such almug trees came or were seen to this day.\n     [13] King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, in addition to that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own land, she and her servants.\n     [14] Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred sixty-six talents of gold,  [15] in addition to that which the traders brought, and the traffic of the merchants, and of all the kings of the mixed people, and of the governors of the country.  [16] King Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of gold went to one buckler.  [17] He made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three minas of gold went to one shield; and the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.  [18] Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold.  [19] There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was round behind; and there were armrests on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the armrests.  [20] Twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps. Nothing like it was made in any kingdom.  [21] All King Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. None were of silver, because it was considered of little value in the days of Solomon.  [22] For the king had a fleet of ships of Tarshish at sea with Hiram’s fleet. Once every three years the fleet of Tarshish came bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.\n     [23] So King Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.  [24] All the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear His wisdom which God had put in His heart.  [25] Year after year, every man brought his tribute, vessels of silver, vessels of gold, clothing, armor, spices, horses, and mules.\n     [26] Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen. He had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen. He kept them in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem.  [27] The king made silver as common as stones in Jerusalem, and cedars as common as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland.  [28] The horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt. The king’s merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price.  [29] A chariot was imported from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty shekels; and so they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and to the kings of Syria.\n"

          "content": "     [1] Now King Solomon loved many foreign women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh: women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites,  [2] of the nations concerning which Yahweh said to the children of Israel, “You shall not go among them, neither shall they come among you, for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods.” Solomon joined to these in love.  [3] He had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines. His wives turned his heart away.  [4] When Solomon was old, His wives turned away His heart after other gods; and His heart was not perfect with Yahweh His God, as the heart of David His father was.  [5] For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.  [6] Solomon did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and didn’t go fully after Yahweh, as David His father did.  [7] Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, on the mountain that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon.  [8] So he did for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods.  [9] Yahweh was angry with Solomon, because His heart was turned away from Yahweh, the God of Israel, who had appeared to Him twice,  [10] and had commanded Him concerning this thing, that He should not go after other gods; but He didn’t keep that which Yahweh commanded.  [11] Therefore Yahweh said to Solomon, “Because this is done by you, and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you, and will give it to your servant.  [12] Nevertheless, I will not do it in your days, for David your father’s sake; but I will tear it out of your son’s hand.  [13] However, I will not tear away all the kingdom; but I will give one tribe to your son, for David my servant’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake which I have chosen.”\n     [14] Yahweh raised up an adversary to Solomon: Hadad the Edomite. He was one of the king’s offspring in Edom.  [15] For when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the army had gone up to bury the slain, and had struck every male in Edom  [16] (for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom),  [17] Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father’s servants with him, to go into Egypt, when Hadad was still a little child.  [18] They arose out of Midian and came to Paran; and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and appointed him food, and gave him land.  [19] Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.  [20] The sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s house among the sons of Pharaoh.  [21] When Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, “Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.”\n     [22] Then Pharaoh said to him, “But what have you lacked with me, that behold, you seek to go to your own country?”\n    He answered, “Nothing, however only let me depart.”\n     [23] God raised up an adversary to Him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from His lord, Hadadezer king of Zobah.  [24] He gathered men to himself, and became captain over a troop, when David killed them of Zobah. They went to Damascus and lived there, and reigned in Damascus.  [25] He was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, in addition to the mischief of Hadad. He abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.\n     [26] Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow, also lifted up his hand against the king.  [27] This was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of his father David’s city.  [28] The man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he put him in charge of all the labor of the house of Joseph.  [29] At that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the way. Now Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment; and the two of them were alone in the field.  [30] Ahijah took the new garment that was on him, and tore it in twelve pieces.  [31] He said to Jeroboam, “Take ten pieces; for Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and will give ten tribes to you  [32] (but he shall have one tribe, for my servant David’s sake and for Jerusalem’s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel),  [33] because they have forsaken me, and have worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon. They have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in my eyes, and to keep my statutes and my ordinances, as David His father did.\n     [34] “‘However, I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant’s sake whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes,  [35] but I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand and will give it to you, even ten tribes.  [36] I will give one tribe to his son, that David my servant may have a lamp always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen for myself to put my name there.  [37] I will take you, and you shall reign according to all that your soul desires, and shall be king over Israel.  [38] It shall be, if you will listen to all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do that which is right in my eyes, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did, that I will be with you, and will build you a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel to you.  [39] I will afflict the offspring of David for this, but not forever.’”\n     [40] Therefore Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam, but Jeroboam arose and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.\n     [41] Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, aren’t they written in the book of the acts of Solomon?  [42] The time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.  [43] Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in his father David’s city; and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.\n"

[2] When Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was yet in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of King Solomon, and Jeroboam lived in Egypt;  [3] and they sent and called him), Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came, and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,  [4] “Your father made our yoke difficult. Now therefore make the hard service of your father, and his heavy yoke which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you.”\n     [5] He said to them, “Depart for three days, then come back to me.”\n    So the people departed.\n     [6] King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, “What counsel do you give me to answer these people?”\n     [7] They replied, “If you will be a servant to this people today, and will serve them, and answer them with good words, then they will be your servants forever.”\n     [8] But he abandoned the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him.  [9] He said to them, “What counsel do you give, that we may answer these people who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter?’”\n     [10] The young men who had grown up with him said to him, “Tell these people who spoke to you, saying, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but make it lighter to us’— tell them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist.  [11] Now my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, but I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.’”\n     [12] So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king asked, saying, “Come to me again the third day.”  [13] The king answered the people roughly, and abandoned the counsel of the old men which they had given him,  [14] and spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.”\n     [15] So the king didn’t listen to the people; for it was a thing brought about from Yahweh, that He might establish His word, which Yahweh spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.  [16] When all Israel saw that the king didn’t listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, “What portion have we in David? We don’t have an inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, Israel! Now see to your own house, David.” So Israel departed to their tents.\n     [17] But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.  [18] Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the men subject to forced labor; and all Israel stoned him to death with stones. King Rehoboam hurried to get himself up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.  [19] So Israel rebelled against David’s house to this day.\n     [20] When all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent and called him to the congregation, and made him king over all Israel. There was no one who followed David’s house, except for the tribe of Judah only.\n     [21] When Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men who were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.  [22] But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,  [23] “Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying,  [24] ‘Yahweh says, “You shall not go up or fight against your brothers, the children of Israel. Everyone return to His house; for this thing is from me.”’” So they listened to Yahweh’s word, and returned and went their way, according to Yahweh’s word.\n     [25] Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and lived in it; and he went out from there and built Penuel.  [26] Jeroboam said in his heart, “Now the kingdom will return to David’s house.  [27] If this people goes up to offer sacrifices in Yahweh’s house at Jerusalem, then the heart of this people will turn again to their lord, even to Rehoboam king of Judah; and they will kill me, and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.”  [28] So the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold; and he said to them, “It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Look and behold your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt!”  [29] He set the one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan.  [30] This thing became a sin, for the people went even as far as Dan to worship before the one there.  [31] He made houses of high places, and made priests from among all the people, who were not of the sons of Levi.  [32] Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast that is in Judah, and he went up to the altar. He did so in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made, and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places that he had made.  [33] He went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and he ordained a feast for the children of Israel, and went up to the altar to burn incense.\n"

          "content": "     [1] Behold, a man of God came out of Judah by Yahweh’s word to Bethel; and Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense.  [2] He cried against the altar by Yahweh’s word, and said, “Altar! Altar! Yahweh says: ‘Behold, a son will be born to David’s house, Josiah by name. On you He will sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and they will burn men’s bones on you.’”  [3] He gave a sign the same day, saying, “This is the sign which Yahweh has spoken: Behold, the altar will be split apart, and the ashes that are on it will be poured out.”\n     [4] When the king heard the saying of the man of God, which He cried against the altar in Bethel, Jeroboam put out His hand from the altar, saying, “Seize Him!” His hand, which He put out against Him, dried up, so that He could not draw it back again to Himself.  [5] The altar was also split apart, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by Yahweh’s word.  [6] The king answered the man of God, “Now intercede for the favor of Yahweh your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again.”\n    The man of God interceded with Yahweh, and the king’s hand was restored to Him again, and became as it was before.\n     [7] The king said to the man of God, “Come home with me and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.”\n     [8] The man of God said to the king, “Even if you gave me half of your house, I would not go in with you, neither would I eat bread nor drink water in this place;  [9] for so was it commanded me by Yahweh’s word, saying, ‘You shall eat no bread, drink no water, and don’t return by the way that you came.’”  [10] So he went another way, and didn’t return by the way that he came to Bethel.\n     [11] Now an old prophet lived in Bethel, and one of His sons came and told Him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel. They also told their father the words which He had spoken to the king.\n     [12] Their father said to them, “Which way did He go?” Now His sons had seen which way the man of God went, who came from Judah.  [13] He said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled the donkey for him; and he rode on it.  [14] He went after the man of God, and found Him sitting under an oak. He said to Him, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?”\n    He said, “I am.”\n     [15] Then he said to him, “Come home with me and eat bread.”\n     [16] He said, “I may not return with you, nor go in with you. I will not eat bread or drink water with you in this place.  [17] For it was said to me by Yahweh’s word, ‘You shall eat no bread or drink water there, and don’t turn again to go by the way that you came.’”\n     [18] He said to Him, “I also am a prophet as you are; and an angel spoke to me by Yahweh’s word, saying, ‘Bring Him back with you into your house, that He may eat bread and drink water.’” He lied to Him.\n     [19] So he went back with him, ate bread in his house, and drank water.  [20] As they sat at the table, Yahweh’s word came to the prophet who brought Him back;  [21] and He cried out to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, “Yahweh says, ‘Because you have been disobedient to Yahweh’s word, and have not kept the commandment which Yahweh your God commanded you,  [22] but came back, and have eaten bread and drank water in the place of which he said to you, “Eat no bread, and drink no water,” your body will not come to the tomb of your fathers.’”\n     [23] After he had eaten bread and after he drank, he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back.  [24] When he had gone, a lion met him by the way and killed him. His body was thrown on the path, and the donkey stood by it. The lion also stood by the body.  [25] Behold, men passed by and saw the body thrown on the path, and the lion standing by the body; and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet lived.  [26] When the prophet who brought Him back from the way heard of it, He said, “It is the man of God who was disobedient to Yahweh’s word. Therefore Yahweh has delivered Him to the lion, which has mauled Him and slain Him, according to Yahweh’s word which He spoke to Him.”  [27] He said to his sons, saying, “Saddle the donkey for me,” and they saddled it.  [28] He went and found his body thrown on the path, and the donkey and the lion standing by the body. The lion had not eaten the body nor mauled the donkey.  [29] The prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it on the donkey, and brought it back. He came to the city of the old prophet to mourn, and to bury Him.  [30] He laid his body in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, “Alas, my brother!”\n     [31] After He had buried Him, He spoke to His sons, saying, “When I am dead, bury me in the tomb in which the man of God is buried. Lay my bones beside His bones.  [32] For the saying which He cried by Yahweh’s word against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, will surely happen.”\n     [33] After this thing, Jeroboam didn’t turn from his evil way, but again made priests of the high places from among all the people. Whoever wanted to, he consecrated him, that there might be priests of the high places.  [34] This thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off and to destroy it from off the surface of the earth.\n"

Behold, Ahijah the prophet is there, who said that I would be king over this people.  [3] Take with you ten loaves of bread, some cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will become of the child.”\n     [4] Jeroboam’s wife did so, and arose and went to Shiloh, and came to Ahijah’s house. Now Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were set by reason of his age.  [5] Yahweh said to Ahijah, “Behold, Jeroboam’s wife is coming to inquire of you concerning her son, for He is sick. Tell her such and such; for it will be, when she comes in, that she will pretend to be another woman.”\n     [6] So when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in at the door, he said, “Come in, Jeroboam’s wife! Why do you pretend to be another? For I am sent to you with heavy news.  [7] Go, tell Jeroboam, ‘Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: “Because I exalted you from among the people, and made you prince over my people Israel,  [8] and tore the kingdom away from David’s house, and gave it you; and yet you have not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in my eyes,  [9] but have done evil above all who were before you, and have gone and made for yourself other gods, molten images, to provoke me to anger, and have cast me behind your back,  [10] therefore, behold, I will bring evil on the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam everyone who urinates on a wall, he who is shut up and he who is left at large in Israel, and will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, as a man sweeps away dung until it is all gone.  [11] The dogs will eat He who belongs to Jeroboam who dies in the city; and the birds of the sky will eat He who dies in the field, for Yahweh has spoken it.”’  [12] Arise therefore, and go to your house. When your feet enter into the city, the child will die.  [13] All Israel will mourn for Him and bury Him; for He only of Jeroboam will come to the grave, because in Him there is found some good thing toward Yahweh, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam.  [14] Moreover Yahweh will raise up a king for Himself over Israel who will cut off the house of Jeroboam. This is the day! What? Even now.  [15] For Yahweh will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water; and He will root up Israel out of this good land which He gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River, because they have made their Asherah poles, provoking Yahweh to anger.  [16] He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he has sinned, and with which he has made Israel to sin.”\n     [17] Jeroboam’s wife arose and departed, and came to Tirzah. As she came to the threshold of the house, the child died.  [18] All Israel buried Him and mourned for Him, according to Yahweh’s word, which He spoke by His servant Ahijah the prophet.\n     [19] The rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he fought and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.  [20] The days which Jeroboam reigned were twenty two years; then he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his place.\n     [21] Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when He began to reign, and He reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Yahweh had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put His name there. His mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess.  [22] Judah did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and they provoked Him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, above all that their fathers had done.  [23] For they also built for themselves high places, sacred pillars, and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree.  [24] There were also sodomites in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations which Yahweh drove out before the children of Israel.\n     [25] In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem;  [26] and He took away the treasures of Yahweh’s house and the treasures of the king’s house. He even took away all of it, including all the gold shields which Solomon had made.  [27] King Rehoboam made shields of bronze in their place, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who kept the door of the king’s house.  [28] It was so, that as often as the king went into Yahweh’s house, the guard bore them, and brought them back into the guard room.\n     [29] Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?  [30] There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.  [31] Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in David’s city. His mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess.

[7] The rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? There was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.  [8] Abijam slept with his fathers, and they buried him in David’s city; and Asa his son reigned in his place.\n     [9] In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa began to reign over Judah.  [10] He reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.  [11] Asa did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, as David His father did.  [12] He put away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.  [13] He also removed Maacah his mother from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah. Asa cut down her image and burned it at the brook Kidron.  [14] But the high places were not taken away. Nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect with Yahweh all His days.  [15] He brought into Yahweh’s house the things that His father had dedicated, and the things that He Himself had dedicated: silver, gold, and utensils.\n     [16] There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.  [17] Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.  [18] Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that was left in the treasures of Yahweh’s house, and the treasures of the king’s house, and delivered it into the hand of His servants. Then King Asa sent them to Ben Hadad, the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, who lived at Damascus, saying,  [19] “Let there be a treaty between me and you, like that between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent to you a present of silver and gold. Go, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.”\n     [20] Ben Hadad listened to King Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel, and struck Ijon, and Dan, and Abel Beth Maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.  [21] When Baasha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah, and lived in Tirzah.  [22] Then King Asa made a proclamation to all Judah. No one was exempted. They carried away the stones of Ramah, and its timber, with which Baasha had built; and King Asa used it to build Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.  [23] Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.  [24] Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in his father David’s city; and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place.\n     [25] Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah; and he reigned over Israel two years.  [26] He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and walked in the way of His father, and in His sin with which He made Israel to sin.  [27] Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha struck him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel were besieging Gibbethon.  [28] Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha killed him and reigned in his place.  [29] As soon as He was king, He struck all the house of Jeroboam. He didn’t leave to Jeroboam any who breathed, until He had destroyed Him, according to the saying of Yahweh, which He spoke by His servant Ahijah the Shilonite;  [30] for the sins of Jeroboam which He sinned, and with which He made Israel to sin, because of His provocation with which He provoked Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger.\n     [31] Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  [32] There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.\n     [33] In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah began to reign over all Israel in Tirzah for twenty-four years.  [34] He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in His sin with which He made Israel to sin.\n"

[4] The dogs will eat Baasha’s descendants who die in the city; and he who dies of his in the field, the birds of the sky will eat.”\n     [5] Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  [6] Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah; and Elah his son reigned in his place.\n     [7] Moreover Yahweh’s word came by the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha and against His house, both because of all the evil that He did in Yahweh’s sight, to provoke Him to anger with the work of His hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam, and because He struck Him.\n     [8] In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha began to reign over Israel in Tirzah for two years.  [9] His servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him. Now he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah;  [10] and Zimri went in and struck him and killed him in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place.\n     [11] When he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, he attacked all the house of Baasha. He didn’t leave him a single one who urinates on a wall among his relatives or his friends.  [12] Thus Zimri destroyed all the house of Baasha, according to Yahweh’s word which He spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,  [13] for all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah His son, which they sinned and with which they made Israel to sin, to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.  [14] Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\n     [15] In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah. Now the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.  [16] The people who were encamped heard that Zimri had conspired, and had also killed the king. Therefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp.  [17] Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.  [18] When Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the fortified part of the king’s house and burned the king’s house over him with fire, and died,  [19] for His sins which He sinned in doing that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in His sin which He did to make Israel to sin.  [20] Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he committed, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\n     [21] Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king, and half followed Omri.  [22] But the people who followed Omri prevailed against the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath; so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.  [23] In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri began to reign over Israel for twelve years. He reigned six years in Tirzah.  [24] He bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver; and he built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, Samaria, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill.  [25] Omri did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and dealt wickedly above all who were before Him.  [26] For He walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in His sins with which He made Israel to sin, to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.  [27] Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  [28] So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria; and Ahab his son reigned in his place.\n     [29] In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab the son of Omri began to reign over Israel. Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years.  [30] Ahab the son of Omri did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight above all that were before Him.  [31] As if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, he took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal and worshiped him.  [32] He raised up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.  [33] Ahab made the Asherah; and Ahab did more yet to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before Him.  [34] In His days Hiel the Bethelite built Jericho. He laid its foundation with the loss of Abiram His firstborn, and set up its gates with the loss of His youngest son Segub, according to Yahweh’s word, which He spoke by Joshua the son of Nun.\n"

[4] You shall drink from the brook. I have commanded the ravens to feed you there.”  [5] So He went and did according to Yahweh’s word, for He went and lived by the brook Cherith that is before the Jordan.  [6] The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening; and he drank from the brook.  [7] After a while, the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land.\n     [8] Yahweh’s word came to Him, saying,  [9] “Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and stay there. Behold, I have commanded a widow there to sustain you.”\n     [10] So he arose and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks. He called to her and said, “Please get me a little water in a jar, that I may drink.”\n     [11] As she was going to get it, he called to her and said, “Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.”\n     [12] She said, “As Yahweh your God lives, I don’t have anything baked, but only a handful of meal in a jar and a little oil in a jar. Behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and bake it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.”\n     [13] Elijah said to her, “Don’t be afraid. Go and do as you have said; but make me a little cake from it first, and bring it out to me, and afterward make some for you and for your son.  [14] For Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘The jar of meal will not run out, and the jar of oil will not fail, until the day that Yahweh sends rain on the earth.’”\n     [15] She went and did according to the saying of Elijah; and she, he, and her household ate many days.  [16] The jar of meal didn’t run out and the jar of oil didn’t fail, according to Yahweh’s word, which He spoke by Elijah.\n     [17] After these things, the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became sick; and his sickness was so severe that there was no breath left in him.  [18] She said to Elijah, “What have I to do with you, you man of God? You have come to me to bring my sin to memory, and to kill my son!”\n     [19] He said to her, “Give me your son.” He took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the room where he stayed, and laid him on his own bed.  [20] He cried to Yahweh and said, “Yahweh my God, have you also brought evil on the widow with whom I am staying, by killing her son?”\n     [21] He stretched Himself on the child three times, and cried to Yahweh and said, “Yahweh my God, please let this child’s soul come into Him again.”\n     [22] Yahweh listened to the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into Him again, and He revived.  [23] Elijah took the child and brought him down out of the room into the house, and delivered him to his mother; and Elijah said, “Behold, your son lives.”\n     [24] The woman said to Elijah, “Now I know that you are a man of God, and that Yahweh’s word in your mouth is truth.”\n"

          "content": "     [1] After many days, Yahweh’s word came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, “Go, show yourself to Ahab; and I will send rain on the earth.”\n     [2] Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. The famine was severe in Samaria.  [3] Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared Yahweh greatly;  [4] for when Jezebel cut off Yahweh’s prophets, Obadiah took one hundred prophets, and hid them fifty to a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)  [5] Ahab said to Obadiah, “Go through the land, to all the springs of water, and to all the brooks. Perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we not lose all the animals.”\n     [6] So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it. Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.  [7] As Obadiah was on the way, behold, Elijah met him. He recognized him, and fell on his face, and said, “Is it you, my lord Elijah?”\n     [8] He answered him, “It is I. Go, tell your lord, ‘Behold, Elijah is here!’”\n     [9] He said, “How have I sinned, that you would deliver your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me?  [10] As Yahweh your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent to seek you. When they said, ‘He is not here,’ He took an oath of the kingdom and nation that they didn’t find you.  [11] Now you say, ‘Go, tell your lord, “Behold, Elijah is here.”’  [12] It will happen, as soon as I leave you, that Yahweh’s Spirit will carry you I don’t know where; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and He can’t find you, He will kill me. But I, your servant, have feared Yahweh from my youth.  [13] Wasn’t it told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed Yahweh’s prophets, how I hid one hundred men of Yahweh’s prophets with fifty to a cave, and fed them with bread and water?  [14] Now you say, ‘Go, tell your lord, “Behold, Elijah is here”.’ He will kill me.”\n     [15] Elijah said, “As Yahweh of Armies lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to Him today.”  [16] So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.\n     [17] When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, “Is that you, you troubler of Israel?”\n     [18] He answered, “I have not troubled Israel, but you and your father’s house, in that you have forsaken Yahweh’s commandments and you have followed the Baals.  [19] Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel to Mount Carmel, and four hundred fifty of the prophets of Baal, and four hundred of the prophets of the Asherah, who eat at Jezebel’s table.”\n     [20] So Ahab sent to all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together to Mount Carmel.  [21] Elijah came near to all the people, and said, “How long will you waver between the two sides? If Yahweh is God, follow Him; but if Baal, then follow Him.”\n    The people didn’t say a word.\n     [22] Then Elijah said to the people, “I, even I only, am left as a prophet of Yahweh; but Baal’s prophets are four hundred fifty men.  [23] Let them therefore give us two bulls; and let them choose one bull for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under; and I will dress the other bull, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under it.  [24] You call on the name of your god, and I will call on Yahweh’s name. The God who answers by fire, let Him be God.”\n    All the people answered, “What you say is good.”\n     [25] Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose one bull for yourselves, and dress it first, for you are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under it.”\n     [26] They took the bull which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, “Baal, hear us!” But there was no voice, and nobody answered. They leaped about the altar which was made.\n     [27] At noon, Elijah mocked them, and said, “Cry aloud, for He is a god. Either He is deep in thought, or He has gone somewhere, or He is on a journey, or perhaps He sleeps and must be awakened.”\n     [28] They cried aloud, and cut themselves in their way with knives and lances until the blood gushed out on them.  [29] When midday was past, they prophesied until the time of the evening offering; but there was no voice, no answer, and nobody paid attention.\n     [30] Elijah said to all the people, “Come near to me!”; and all the people came near to Him. He repaired Yahweh’s altar that had been thrown down.  [31] Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom Yahweh’s word came, saying, “Israel shall be your name.”  [32] With the stones He built an altar in Yahweh’s name. He made a trench around the altar large enough to contain two seahs of seed.  [33] He put the wood in order, and cut the bull in pieces and laid it on the wood. He said, “Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood.”  [34] He said, “Do it a second time;” and they did it the second time. He said, “Do it a third time;” and they did it the third time.  [35] The water ran around the altar; and he also filled the trench with water.\n     [36] At the time of the evening offering, Elijah the prophet came near and said, “Yahweh, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word.  [37] Hear me, Yahweh, hear me, that this people may know that you, Yahweh, are God, and that you have turned their heart back again.”\n     [38] Then Yahweh’s fire fell and consumed the burnt offering, the wood, the stones, and the dust; and it licked up the water that was in the trench.  [39] When all the people saw it, they fell on their faces. They said, “Yahweh, He is God! Yahweh, He is God!”\n     [40] Elijah said to them, “Seize the prophets of Baal! Don’t let one of them escape!”\n    They seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and killed them there.\n     [41] Elijah said to Ahab, “Get up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.”\n     [42] So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself down on the earth, and put his face between his knees.  [43] He said to his servant, “Go up now and look toward the sea.”\n    He went up and looked, then said, “There is nothing.”\n    He said, “Go again” seven times.\n     [44] On the seventh time, he said, “Behold, a small cloud, like a man’s hand, is rising out of the sea.”\n    He said, “Go up, tell Ahab, ‘Get ready and go down, so that the rain doesn’t stop you.’”\n     [45] In a little while, the sky grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.  [46] Yahweh’s hand was on Elijah; and He tucked His cloak into His belt and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.\n"

[2] Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I don’t make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time!”\n     [3] When he saw that, he arose and ran for his life, and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there.  [4] But He Himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree. Then He requested for Himself that He might die, and said, “It is enough. Now, O Yahweh, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.”\n     [5] He lay down and slept under a juniper tree; and behold, an angel touched him, and said to him, “Arise and eat!”\n     [6] He looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked on the coals, and a jar of water. He ate and drank, and lay down again.  [7] Yahweh’s angel came again the second time, and touched Him, and said, “Arise and eat, because the journey is too great for you.”\n     [8] He arose, and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb, God’s Mountain.  [9] He came to a cave there, and camped there; and behold, Yahweh’s word came to Him, and He said to Him, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”\n     [10] He said, “I have been very jealous for Yahweh, the God of Armies; for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.”\n     [11] He said, “Go out and stand on the mountain before Yahweh.”\n    Behold, Yahweh passed by, and a great and strong wind tore the mountains and broke in pieces the rocks before Yahweh; but Yahweh was not in the wind. After the wind there was an earthquake; but Yahweh was not in the earthquake.  [12] After the earthquake a fire passed; but Yahweh was not in the fire. After the fire, there was a still small voice.  [13] When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle, went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave. Behold, a voice came to him, and said, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”\n     [14] He said, “I have been very jealous for Yahweh, the God of Armies; for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.”\n     [15] Yahweh said to Him, “Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus. When you arrive, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria.  [16] Anoint Jehu the son of Nimshi to be king over Israel; and anoint Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel Meholah to be prophet in your place.  [17] He who escapes from the sword of Hazael, Jehu will kill; and he who escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha will kill.  [18] Yet I reserved seven thousand in Israel, all the knees of which have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth which has not kissed him.”\n     [19] So he departed from there and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth. Elijah went over to him and put his mantle on him.  [20] Elisha left the oxen and ran after Elijah, and said, “Let me please kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you.”\n    He said to him, “Go back again; for what have I done to you?”\n     [21] He returned from following him, and took the yoke of oxen, killed them, and boiled their meat with the oxen’s equipment, and gave to the people; and they ate. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and served him.\n"

Your wives also and your children, even the best, are mine.’”\n     [4] The king of Israel answered, “It is according to your saying, my lord, O king.

[17] The young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben Hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, “Men are coming out from Samaria.”\n     [18] He said, “If they have come out for peace, take them alive; or if they have come out for war, take them alive.”\n     [19] So these went out of the city, the young men of the princes of the provinces, and the army which followed them.  [20] They each killed his man. The Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them. Ben Hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with horsemen.  [21] The king of Israel went out and struck the horses and chariots, and killed the Syrians with a great slaughter.  [22] The prophet came near to the king of Israel and said to him, “Go, strengthen yourself, and plan what you must do, for at the return of the year, the king of Syria will come up against you.”\n     [23] The servants of the king of Syria said to Him, “Their god is a god of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we. But let’s fight against them in the plain, and surely we will be stronger than they.  [24] Do this thing: take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their place.  [25] Muster an army like the army that you have lost, horse for horse and chariot for chariot. We will fight against them in the plain, and surely we will be stronger than they are.”\n    He listened to their voice and did so.  [26] At the return of the year, Ben Hadad mustered the Syrians and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.  [27] The children of Israel were mustered and given provisions, and went against them. The children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of young goats, but the Syrians filled the country.  [28] A man of God came near and spoke to the king of Israel, and said, “Yahweh says, ‘Because the Syrians have said, “Yahweh is a god of the hills, but He is not a god of the valleys,” therefore I will deliver all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am Yahweh.’”\n     [29] They encamped opposite each other for seven days. Then on the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel killed one hundred thousand footmen of the Syrians in one day.  [30] But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand men who were left. Ben Hadad fled and came into the city, into an inner room.  [31] His servants said to him, “See now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Please let us put sackcloth on our bodies and ropes on our heads, and go out to the king of Israel. Maybe he will save your life.”\n     [32] So they put sackcloth on their bodies and ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, “Your servant Ben Hadad says, ‘Please let me live.’”\n    He said, “Is he still alive? He is my brother.”\n     [33] Now the men observed diligently and hurried to take this phrase; and they said, “Your brother Ben Hadad.”\n    Then he said, “Go, bring him.”\n    Then Ben Hadad came out to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.  [34] Ben Hadad said to him, “The cities which my father took from your father I will restore. You shall make streets for yourself in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria.”\n    “I”, said Ahab, “will let you go with this covenant.” So he made a covenant with him and let him go.\n     [35] A certain man of the sons of the prophets said to His fellow by Yahweh’s word, “Please strike me!”\n    The man refused to strike Him.  [36] Then He said to Him, “Because you have not obeyed Yahweh’s voice, behold, as soon as you have departed from me, a lion will kill you.” As soon as He had departed from Him, a lion found Him and killed Him.\n     [37] Then he found another man, and said, “Please strike me.”\n    The man struck him and wounded him.  [38] So the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes.  [39] As the king passed by, he cried to the king, and he said, “Your servant went out into the middle of the battle; and behold, a man came over and brought a man to me, and said, ‘Guard this man! If by any means he is missing, then your life shall be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.’  [40] As your servant was busy here and there, he was gone.”\n    The king of Israel said to him, “So shall your judgment be. You yourself have decided it.”\n     [41] He hurried, and took the headband away from his eyes; and the king of Israel recognized that he was one of the prophets.  [42] He said to Him, “Yahweh says, ‘Because you have let go out of your hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore your life will take the place of His life, and your people take the place of His people.’”\n     [43] The king of Israel went to his house sullen and angry, and came to Samaria.\n"

          "content": "     [1] After these things, Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard which was in Jezreel, next to the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.  [2] Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, “Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near my house; and I will give you for it a better vineyard than it. Or, if it seems good to you, I will give you its worth in money.”\n     [3] Naboth said to Ahab, “May Yahweh forbid me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you!”\n     [4] Ahab came into his house sullen and angry because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him, for he had said, “I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.” He laid himself down on his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.  [5] But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, “Why is your spirit so sad that you eat no bread?”\n     [6] He said to her, “Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, ‘Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it pleases you, I will give you another vineyard for it.’ He answered, ‘I will not give you my vineyard.’”\n     [7] Jezebel his wife said to him, “Do you now govern the kingdom of Israel? Arise, and eat bread, and let your heart be merry. I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.”  [8] So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles who were in his city, who lived with Naboth.  [9] She wrote in the letters, saying, “Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.  [10] Set two men, wicked fellows, before Him, and let them testify against Him, saying, ‘You cursed God and the king!’ Then carry Him out, and stone Him to death.”\n     [11] The men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had instructed them in the letters which she had written and sent to them.  [12] They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.  [13] The two men, the wicked fellows, came in and sat before Him. The wicked fellows testified against Him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, “Naboth cursed God and the king!” Then they carried Him out of the city and stoned Him to death with stones.  [14] Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, “Naboth has been stoned and is dead.”\n     [15] When Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, Jezebel said to Ahab, “Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.”\n     [16] When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.\n     [17] Yahweh’s word came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,  [18] “Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who dwells in Samaria. Behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone down to take possession of it.  [19] You shall speak to Him, saying, ‘Yahweh says, “Have you killed and also taken possession?”’ You shall speak to Him, saying, ‘Yahweh says, “In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth, dogs will lick your blood, even yours.”’”\n     [20] Ahab said to Elijah, “Have you found me, my enemy?”\n    He answered, “I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do that which is evil in Yahweh’s sight.  [21] Behold, I will bring evil on you, and will utterly sweep you away and will cut off from Ahab everyone who urinates against a wall, and him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel.  [22] I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation with which you have provoked me to anger, and have made Israel to sin.”  [23] Yahweh also spoke of Jezebel, saying, “The dogs will eat Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel.  [24] The dogs will eat he who dies of Ahab in the city; and the birds of the sky will eat he who dies in the field.”\n     [25] But there was no one like Ahab, who sold Himself to do that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, whom Jezebel His wife stirred up.  [26] He did very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites did, whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel.\n     [27] When Ahab heard those words, he tore his clothes, put sackcloth on his body, fasted, lay in sackcloth, and went about despondently.\n     [28] Yahweh’s word came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,  [29] “See how Ahab humbles himself before me? Because he humbles himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days; but I will bring the evil on his house in his son’s day.”\n"

          "content": "     [1] They continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.  [2] In the third year, Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.  [3] The king of Israel said to his servants, “You know that Ramoth Gilead is ours, and we do nothing, and don’t take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?”  [4] He said to Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to battle to Ramoth Gilead?”\n    Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”  [5] Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “Please inquire first for Yahweh’s word.”\n     [6] Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, “Should I go against Ramoth Gilead to battle, or should I refrain?”\n    They said, “Go up; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.”\n     [7] But Jehoshaphat said, “Isn’t there here a prophet of Yahweh, that we may inquire of Him?”\n     [8] The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Yahweh, Micaiah the son of Imlah; but I hate Him, for He does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil.”\n    Jehoshaphat said, “Don’t let the king say so.”\n     [9] Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, “Quickly get Micaiah the son of Imlah.”\n     [10] Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.  [11] Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made Himself horns of iron, and said, “Yahweh says, ‘With these you will push the Syrians, until they are consumed.’”  [12] All the prophets prophesied so, saying, “Go up to Ramoth Gilead and prosper; for Yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the king.”\n     [13] The messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, “See now, the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth. Please let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak good.”\n     [14] Micaiah said, “As Yahweh lives, what Yahweh says to me, that I will speak.”\n     [15] When He had come to the king, the king said to Him, “Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall we forbear?”\n    He answered Him, “Go up and prosper; and Yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the king.”\n     [16] The king said to Him, “How many times do I have to adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in Yahweh’s name?”\n     [17] He said, “I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. Yahweh said, ‘These have no master. Let them each return to His house in peace.’”\n     [18] The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?”\n     [19] Micaiah said, “Therefore hear Yahweh’s word. I saw Yahweh sitting on His throne, and all the army of heaven standing by Him on His right hand and on His left.  [20] Yahweh said, ‘Who will entice Ahab, that He may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead?’ One said one thing, and another said another.\n     [21] A spirit came out and stood before Yahweh, and said, ‘I will entice Him.’\n     [22] Yahweh said to Him, ‘How?’\n    He said, ‘I will go out and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all His prophets.’\n    He said, ‘You will entice Him, and will also prevail. Go out and do so.’  [23] Now therefore, behold, Yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets; and Yahweh has spoken evil concerning you.”\n     [24] Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, “Which way did Yahweh’s Spirit go from me to speak to you?”\n     [25] Micaiah said, “Behold, you will see on that day when you go into an inner room to hide yourself.”\n     [26] The king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king’s son.  [27] Say, ‘The king says, “Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.”’”\n     [28] Micaiah said, “If you return at all in peace, Yahweh has not spoken by me.” He said, “Listen, all you people!”\n     [29] So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.  [30] The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into the battle, but you put on your robes.” The king of Israel disguised himself and went into the battle.\n     [31] Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, saying, “Don’t fight with small nor great, except only with the king of Israel.”\n     [32] When the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “Surely that is the king of Israel!” and they came over to fight against him. Jehoshaphat cried out.  [33] When the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.  [34] A certain man drew his bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armor. Therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, “Turn around, and carry me out of the battle, for I am severely wounded.”  [35] The battle increased that day. The king was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians, and died at evening. The blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot.  [36] A cry went throughout the army about the going down of the sun, saying, “Every man to his city, and every man to his country!”\n     [37] So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.  [38] They washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up His blood where the prostitutes washed themselves, according to Yahweh’s word which He spoke.\n     [39] Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  [40] So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place.\n     [41] Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.  [42] Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.  [43] He walked in all the way of Asa His father. He didn’t turn away from it, doing that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes. However, the high places were not taken away. The people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.  [44] Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.\n     [45] Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he fought, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?  [46] The remnant of the sodomites, that remained in the days of his father Asa, he put away out of the land.  [47] There was no king in Edom. A deputy ruled.  [48] Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold, but they didn’t go, for the ships wrecked at Ezion Geber.  [49] Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my servants go with your servants in the ships.” But Jehoshaphat would not.  [50] Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in his father David’s city. Jehoram his son reigned in his place.\n     [51] Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel.  [52] He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and walked in the way of His father, and in the way of His mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, in which He made Israel to sin.  [53] He served Baal and worshiped Him, and provoked Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger in all the ways that His father had done so.\n"

So He sent messengers, and said to them, “Go, inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I will recover of this sickness.”\n     [3] But Yahweh’s angel said to Elijah the Tishbite, “Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and tell them, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you go to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron?  [4] Now therefore Yahweh says, “You will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but you will surely die.”’” Then Elijah departed.\n     [5] The messengers returned to him, and he said to them, “Why is it that you have returned?”\n     [6] They said to Him, “A man came up to meet us, and said to us, ‘Go, return to the king who sent you, and tell Him, “Yahweh says, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you send to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but you will surely die.’”’”\n     [7] He said to them, “What kind of man was he who came up to meet you and told you these words?”\n     [8] They answered him, “He was a hairy man, and wearing a leather belt around his waist.”\n    He said, “It’s Elijah the Tishbite.”\n     [9] Then the king sent a captain of fifty with His fifty to Him. He went up to Him; and behold, He was sitting on the top of the hill. He said to Him, “Man of God, the king has said, ‘Come down!’”\n     [10] Elijah answered to the captain of fifty, “If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from the sky and consume you and your fifty!” Then fire came down from the sky, and consumed Him and His fifty.\n     [11] Again He sent to Him another captain of fifty with His fifty. He answered Him, “Man of God, the king has said, ‘Come down quickly!’”\n     [12] Elijah answered them, “If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from the sky and consume you and your fifty!” Then God’s fire came down from the sky, and consumed Him and His fifty.\n     [13] Again He sent the captain of a third fifty with His fifty. The third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on His knees before Elijah, and begged Him, and said to Him, “Man of God, please let my life and the life of these fifty of your servants be precious in your sight.  [14] Behold, fire came down from the sky and consumed the last two captains of fifty with their fifties. But now let my life be precious in your sight.”\n     [15] Yahweh’s angel said to Elijah, “Go down with Him. Don’t be afraid of Him.”\n    Then He arose and went down with Him to the king.  [16] He said to Him, “Yahweh says, ‘Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of His word? Therefore you will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but you will surely die.’”\n     [17] So He died according to Yahweh’s word which Elijah had spoken. Jehoram began to reign in His place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, because He had no son.  [18] Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?\n"

[2] Elijah said to Elisha, “Please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me as far as Bethel.”\n    Elisha said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” So they went down to Bethel.\n     [3] The sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to Him, “Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from over you today?”\n    He said, “Yes, I know it. Hold your peace.”\n     [4] Elijah said to Him, “Elisha, please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me to Jericho.”\n    He said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” So they came to Jericho.\n     [5] The sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said to Him, “Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from over you today?”\n    He answered, “Yes, I know it. Hold your peace.”\n     [6] Elijah said to Him, “Please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me to the Jordan.”\n    He said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” Then they both went on.  [7] Fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood opposite them at a distance; and they both stood by the Jordan.  [8] Elijah took his mantle, and rolled it up, and struck the waters; and they were divided here and there, so that they both went over on dry ground.  [9] When they had gone over, Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask what I shall do for you, before I am taken from you.”\n    Elisha said, “Please let a double portion of your spirit be on me.”\n     [10] He said, “You have asked a hard thing. If you see me when I am taken from you, it will be so for you; but if not, it will not be so.”\n     [11] As they continued on and talked, behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated them; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.  [12] Elisha saw it, and he cried, “My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!”\n    He saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them in two pieces.  [13] He also took up Elijah’s mantle that fell from him, and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan.  [14] He took Elijah’s mantle that fell from Him, and struck the waters, and said, “Where is Yahweh, the God of Elijah?” When He also had struck the waters, they were divided apart, and Elisha went over.\n     [15] When the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho facing him saw him, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” They came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.  [16] They said to Him, “See now, there are with your servants fifty strong men. Please let them go and seek your master. Perhaps Yahweh’s Spirit has taken Him up, and put Him on some mountain or into some valley.”\n    He said, “Don’t send them.”\n     [17] When they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, “Send them.”\n    Therefore they sent fifty men; and they searched for three days, but didn’t find him.  [18] They came back to him while he stayed at Jericho; and he said to them, “Didn’t I tell you, ‘Don’t go?’”\n     [19] The men of the city said to Elisha, “Behold, please, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the land is barren.”\n     [20] He said, “Bring me a new jar, and put salt in it.” Then they brought it to him.  [21] He went out to the spring of the waters, and threw salt into it, and said, “Yahweh says, ‘I have healed these waters. There shall not be from there any more death or barren wasteland.’”  [22] So the waters were healed to this day, according to Elisha’s word which he spoke.\n     [23] He went up from there to Bethel. As he was going up by the way, some youths came out of the city and mocked him, and said to him, “Go up, you baldy! Go up, you baldy!”  [24] He looked behind Him and saw them, and cursed them in Yahweh’s name. Then two female bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of those youths.  [25] He went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.\n"

[2] He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, but not like His father and like His mother, for He put away the pillar of Baal that His father had made.

He didn’t depart from them.\n     [4] Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder; and he supplied the king of Israel with one hundred thousand lambs and the wool of one hundred thousand rams.

I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”  [8] Then he said, “Which way shall we go up?”\n    Jehoram answered, “The way of the wilderness of Edom.”\n     [9] So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom, and they marched for seven days along a circuitous route. There was no water for the army or for the animals that followed them.  [10] The king of Israel said, “Alas! For Yahweh has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.”\n     [11] But Jehoshaphat said, “Isn’t there a prophet of Yahweh here, that we may inquire of Yahweh by Him?”\n    One of the king of Israel’s servants answered, “Elisha the son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah, is here.”\n     [12] Jehoshaphat said, “Yahweh’s word is with Him.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to Him.\n     [13] Elisha said to the king of Israel, “What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father, and to the prophets of your mother.”\n    The king of Israel said to Him, “No, for Yahweh has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.”\n     [14] Elisha said, “As Yahweh of Armies lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I respect the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward you, nor see you.  [15] But now bring me a musician.” When the musician played, Yahweh’s hand came on Him.  [16] He said, “Yahweh says, ‘Make this valley full of trenches.’  [17] For Yahweh says, ‘You will not see wind, neither will you see rain, yet that valley will be filled with water, and you will drink, both you and your livestock and your other animals.  [18] This is an easy thing in Yahweh’s sight. He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.  [19] You shall strike every fortified city and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all springs of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.’”\n     [20] In the morning, about the time of offering the sacrifice, behold, water came by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.\n     [21] Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all who were able to put on armor, young and old, and stood on the border.  [22] They rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the water opposite them as red as blood.  [23] They said, “This is blood. The kings are surely destroyed, and they have struck each other. Now therefore, Moab, to the plunder!”\n     [24] When they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land attacking the Moabites.  [25] They beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land each man cast his stone, and filled it. They also stopped all the springs of water and cut down all the good trees, until in Kir Hareseth all they left was its stones; however the men armed with slings went around it and attacked it.  [26] When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew a sword, to break through to the king of Edom; but they could not.  [27] Then he took his oldest son who would have reigned in his place, and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall. There was great wrath against Israel; and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.\n"

Now the creditor has come to take for Himself my two children to be slaves.”\n     [2] Elisha said to her, “What should I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?”\n    She said, “Your servant has nothing in the house, except a pot of oil.”\n     [3] Then he said, “Go, borrow empty containers from all your neighbors. Don’t borrow just a few containers.  [4] Go in and shut the door on you and on your sons, and pour oil into all those containers; and set aside those which are full.”\n     [5] So she went from him, and shut the door on herself and on her sons. They brought the containers to her, and she poured oil.  [6] When the containers were full, she said to her son, “Bring me another container.”\n    He said to her, “There isn’t another container.” Then the oil stopped flowing.\n     [7] Then she came and told the man of God. He said, “Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt; and you and your sons live on the rest.”\n     [8] One day Elisha went to Shunem, where there was a prominent woman; and she persuaded him to eat bread. So it was, that as often as he passed by, he turned in there to eat bread.  [9] She said to her husband, “See now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God who passes by us continually.  [10] Please, let’s make a little room on the roof. Let’s set a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp stand for him there. When he comes to us, he can stay there.”\n     [11] One day he came there, and he went to the room and lay there.  [12] He said to Gehazi his servant, “Call this Shunammite.” When he had called her, she stood before him.  [13] He said to him, “Say now to her, ‘Behold, you have cared for us with all this care. What is to be done for you? Would you like to be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the army?’”\n    She answered, “I dwell among my own people.”\n     [14] He said, “What then is to be done for her?”\n    Gehazi answered, “Most certainly she has no son, and her husband is old.”\n     [15] He said, “Call her.” When he had called her, she stood in the door.  [16] He said, “At this season next year, you will embrace a son.”\n    She said, “No, my lord, you man of God, do not lie to your servant.”\n     [17] The woman conceived, and bore a son at that season when the time came around, as Elisha had said to her.  [18] When the child was grown, one day he went out to his father to the reapers.  [19] He said to his father, “My head! My head!”\n    He said to his servant, “Carry him to his mother.”\n     [20] When he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees until noon, and then died.  [21] She went up and laid Him on the man of God’s bed, and shut the door on Him, and went out.  [22] She called to her husband and said, “Please send me one of the servants, and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God and come again.”\n     [23] He said, “Why would you want go to him today? It is not a new moon or a Sabbath.”\n    She said, “It’s all right.”\n     [24] Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, “Drive, and go forward! Don’t slow down for me, unless I ask you to.”\n     [25] So she went, and came to the man of God to Mount Carmel. When the man of God saw her afar off, He said to Gehazi His servant, “Behold, there is the Shunammite.  [26] Please run now to meet her, and ask her, ‘Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with your child?’”\n    She answered, “It is well.”\n     [27] When she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of His feet. Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, “Leave her alone, for her soul is troubled within her; and Yahweh has hidden it from me, and has not told me.”\n     [28] Then she said, “Did I ask you for a son, my lord? Didn’t I say, ‘Do not deceive me’?”\n     [29] Then he said to Gehazi, “Tuck your cloak into your belt, take my staff in your hand, and go your way. If you meet any man, don’t greet him; and if anyone greets you, don’t answer him again. Then lay my staff on the child’s face.”\n     [30] The child’s mother said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.”\n    So He arose, and followed her.\n     [31] Gehazi went ahead of them, and laid the staff on the child’s face; but there was no voice and no hearing. Therefore he returned to meet him, and told him, “The child has not awakened.”\n     [32] When Elisha had come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and lying on his bed.  [33] He went in therefore, and shut the door on them both, and prayed to Yahweh.  [34] He went up and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands. He stretched himself on him; and the child’s flesh grew warm.  [35] Then he returned, and walked in the house once back and forth, then went up and stretched himself out on him. Then the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.  [36] He called Gehazi, and said, “Call this Shunammite!” So he called her.\n    When she had come in to him, he said, “Take up your son.”\n     [37] Then she went in, fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground; then she picked up her son, and went out.\n     [38] Elisha came again to Gilgal. There was a famine in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said to his servant, “Get the large pot, and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.”\n     [39] One went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered a lap full of wild gourds from it, and came and cut them up into the pot of stew; for they didn’t recognize them.  [40] So they poured out for the men to eat. As they were eating some of the stew, they cried out and said, “Man of God, there is death in the pot!” And they could not eat it.\n     [41] But he said, “Then bring meal.” He threw it into the pot; and he said, “Serve it to the people, that they may eat.” And there was nothing harmful in the pot.\n     [42] A man from Baal Shalishah came, and brought the man of God some bread of the first fruits: twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of grain in His sack. Elisha said, “Give to the people, that they may eat.”\n     [43] His servant said, “What, should I set this before a hundred men?”\n    But He said, “Give it to the people, that they may eat; for Yahweh says, ‘They will eat, and will have some left over.’”\n     [44] So He set it before them and they ate and had some left over, according to Yahweh’s word.\n"

[2] The Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little girl, and she waited on Naaman’s wife.  [3] She said to her mistress, “I wish that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would heal him of his leprosy.”\n     [4] Someone went in and told his lord, saying, “The girl who is from the land of Israel said this.”\n     [5] The king of Syria said, “Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.”\n    He departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of clothing.  [6] He brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, “Now when this letter has come to you, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may heal him of his leprosy.”\n     [7] When the king of Israel had read the letter, He tore His clothes and said, “Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends to me to heal a man of His leprosy? But please consider and see how He seeks a quarrel against me.”\n     [8] It was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn His clothes, that He sent to the king, saying, “Why have you torn your clothes? Let Him come now to me, and He shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.”\n     [9] So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.  [10] Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, “Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall come again to you, and you shall be clean.”\n     [11] But Naaman was angry, and went away and said, “Behold, I thought, ‘He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of Yahweh His God, and wave His hand over the place, and heal the leper.’  [12] Aren’t Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Couldn’t I wash in them and be clean?” So he turned and went away in a rage.\n     [13] His servants came near and spoke to him, and said, “My father, if the prophet had asked you do some great thing, wouldn’t you have done it? How much rather then, when he says to you, ‘Wash, and be clean?’”\n     [14] Then went He down and dipped Himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and His flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and He was clean.  [15] He returned to the man of God, He and all His company, and came, and stood before Him; and He said, “See now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel. Now therefore, please take a gift from your servant.”\n     [16] But He said, “As Yahweh lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none.”\n    He urged Him to take it; but He refused.  [17] Naaman said, “If not, then, please let two mules’ load of earth be given to your servant; for your servant will from now on offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to Yahweh.  [18] In this thing may Yahweh pardon your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and He leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon. When I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, may Yahweh pardon your servant in this thing.”\n     [19] He said to him, “Go in peace.”\n    So he departed from him a little way.  [20] But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, “Behold, my master has spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at His hands that which He brought. As Yahweh lives, I will run after Him, and take something from Him.”\n     [21] So Gehazi followed after Naaman. When Naaman saw one running after him, he came down from the chariot to meet him, and said, “Is all well?”\n     [22] He said, “All is well. My master has sent me, saying, ‘Behold, even now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothing.’”\n     [23] Naaman said, “Be pleased to take two talents.” He urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing, and laid them on two of his servants; and they carried them before him.  [24] When he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and stored them in the house. Then he let the men go, and they departed.  [25] But he went in, and stood before his master. Elisha said to him, “Where did you come from, Gehazi?”\n    He said, “Your servant went nowhere.”\n     [26] He said to him, “Didn’t my heart go with you when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive groves and vineyards, and sheep and cattle, and male servants and female servants?  [27] Therefore the leprosy of Naaman will cling to you and to your offspring forever.”\n    He went out from his presence a leper, as white as snow.\n"

[2] Please let us go to the Jordan, and each man take a beam from there, and let’s make us a place there, where we may live.”\n    He answered, “Go!”\n     [3] One said, “Please be pleased to go with your servants.”\n    He answered, “I will go.”  [4] So he went with them. When they came to the Jordan, they cut down wood.  [5] But as one was cutting down a tree, the ax head fell into the water. Then he cried out and said, “Alas, my master! For it was borrowed.”\n     [6] The man of God asked, “Where did it fall?” He showed Him the place. He cut down a stick, threw it in there, and made the iron float.  [7] He said, “Take it.” So he put out his hand and took it.\n     [8] Now the king of Syria was at war against Israel; and he took counsel with his servants, saying, “My camp will be in such and such a place.”\n     [9] The man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, “Beware that you not pass this place, for the Syrians are coming down there.”  [10] The king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told Him and warned Him of; and He saved Himself there, not once or twice.  [11] The king of Syria’s heart was very troubled about this. He called his servants, and said to them, “Won’t you show me which of us is for the king of Israel?”\n     [12] One of his servants said, “No, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom.”\n     [13] He said, “Go and see where he is, that I may send and get him.”\n    He was told, “Behold, he is in Dothan.”\n     [14] Therefore he sent horses, chariots, and a great army there. They came by night and surrounded the city.  [15] When the servant of the man of God had risen early and gone out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was around the city. His servant said to Him, “Alas, my master! What shall we do?”\n     [16] He answered, “Don’t be afraid, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.”  [17] Elisha prayed, and said, “Yahweh, please open His eyes, that He may see.” Yahweh opened the young man’s eyes, and He saw; and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire around Elisha.  [18] When they came down to Him, Elisha prayed to Yahweh, and said, “Please strike this people with blindness.”\n    He struck them with blindness according to Elisha’s word.\n     [19] Elisha said to them, “This is not the way, neither is this the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek.” He led them to Samaria.  [20] When they had come into Samaria, Elisha said, “Yahweh, open these men’s eyes, that they may see.”\n    Yahweh opened their eyes, and they saw; and behold, they were in the middle of Samaria.\n     [21] The king of Israel said to Elisha, when he saw them, “My father, shall I strike them? Shall I strike them?”\n     [22] He answered, “You shall not strike them. Would you strike those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, then go to their master.”\n     [23] He prepared a great feast for them. After they ate and drank, he sent them away and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria stopped raiding the land of Israel.\n     [24] After this, Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up and besieged Samaria.  [25] There was a great famine in Samaria. Behold, they besieged it until a donkey’s head was sold for eighty pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a kab of dove’s dung for five pieces of silver.  [26] As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried to him, saying, “Help, my lord, O king!”\n     [27] He said, “If Yahweh doesn’t help you, where could I get help for you? From of the threshing floor, or from the wine press?”  [28] Then the king asked her, “What is your problem?”\n    She answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give your son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.’  [29] So we boiled my son and ate him; and I said to her on the next day, ‘Give up your son, that we may eat him;’ and she has hidden her son.”\n     [30] When the king heard the words of the woman, he tore his clothes. Now he was passing by on the wall, and the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth underneath on his body.  [31] Then He said, “God do so to me, and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat stays on Him today.”\n     [32] But Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. Then the king sent a man from before him; but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, “Do you see how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head? Behold, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold the door shut against him. Isn’t the sound of his master’s feet behind him?”\n     [33] While He was still talking with them, behold, the messenger came down to Him. Then He said, “Behold, this evil is from Yahweh. Why should I wait for Yahweh any longer?”\n"

They said to one another, “Why do we sit here until we die?  [4] If we say, ‘We will enter into the city,’ then the famine is in the city, and we will die there. If we sit still here, we also die. Now therefore come, and let’s surrender to the army of the Syrians. If they save us alive, we will live; and if they kill us, we will only die.”\n     [5] They rose up in the twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians. When they had come to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians, behold, no man was there.  [6] For the Lord had made the army of the Syrians to hear the sound of chariots and the sound of horses, even the noise of a great army; and they said to one another, “Behold, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians to attack us.”  [7] Therefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, their horses, and their donkeys, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.  [8] When these lepers came to the outermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and ate and drank, then carried away silver, gold, and clothing and went and hid it. Then they came back, and entered into another tent and carried things from there also, and went and hid them.  [9] Then they said to one another, “We aren’t doing right. Today is a day of good news, and we keep silent. If we wait until the morning light, punishment will overtake us. Now therefore come, let’s go and tell the king’s household.”\n     [10] So they came and called to the city gatekeepers; and they told them, “We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, not even a man’s voice, but the horses tied, and the donkeys tied, and the tents as they were.”\n     [11] Then the gatekeepers called out and told it to the king’s household within.\n     [12] The king arose in the night, and said to his servants, “I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry. Therefore they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, ‘When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive, and get into the city.’”\n     [13] One of his servants answered, “Please let some people take five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city. Behold, they are like all the multitude of Israel who are left in it. Behold, they are like all the multitude of Israel who are consumed. Let’s send and see.”\n     [14] Therefore they took two chariots with horses; and the king sent them out to the Syrian army, saying, “Go and see.”\n     [15] They went after them to the Jordan; and behold, all the path was full of garments and equipment which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. The messengers returned and told the king.  [16] The people went out and plundered the camp of the Syrians. So a seah of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to Yahweh’s word.  [17] The king had appointed the captain on whose hand He leaned to be in charge of the gate; and the people trampled over Him in the gate, and He died as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to Him.  [18] It happened as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, “Two seahs of barley for a shekel, and a seah of fine flour for a shekel, shall be tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria;”  [19] and that captain answered the man of God, and said, “Now, behold, if Yahweh made windows in heaven, might such a thing be?” and He said, “Behold, you will see it with your eyes, but will not eat of it.”  [20] It happened like that to him, for the people trampled over him in the gate, and he died.\n"

Then she went out to beg the king for her house and for her land.

Gehazi said, “My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.”\n     [6] When the king asked the woman, she told him.

You will set their strongholds on fire, and you will kill their young men with the sword, and will dash their little ones in pieces, and rip up their pregnant women.”\n     [13] Hazael said, “But what is your servant, who is but a dog, that He could do this great thing?”\n    Elisha answered, “Yahweh has shown me that you will be king over Syria.”\n     [14] Then he departed from Elisha, and came to his master, who said to him, “What did Elisha say to you?”\n    He answered, “He told me that you would surely recover.”\n     [15] On the next day, he took a thick cloth, dipped it in water, and spread it on the king’s face, so that he died. Then Hazael reigned in his place.\n     [16] In the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being king of Judah then, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.  [17] He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign. He reigned eight years in Jerusalem.  [18] He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did Ahab’s house, for He married Ahab’s daughter. He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight.  [19] However, Yahweh would not destroy Judah, for David His servant’s sake, as He promised Him to give to Him a lamp for His children always.\n     [20] In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.  [21] Then Joram crossed over to Zair, and all his chariots with him; and he rose up by night and struck the Edomites who surrounded him with the captains of the chariots; and the people fled to their tents.  [22] So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.  [23] The rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?  [24] Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in David’s city; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place.\n     [25] In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign.  [26] Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel.  [27] He walked in the way of Ahab’s house and did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, as did Ahab’s house, for He was the son-in-law of Ahab’s house.\n     [28] He went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead, and the Syrians wounded Joram.  [29] King Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel from the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.\n"

[2] When you come there, find Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in and make him rise up from among his brothers, and take him to an inner room.  [3] Then take the vial of oil, and pour it on His head, and say, ‘Yahweh says, “I have anointed you king over Israel.”’ Then open the door, flee, and don’t wait.”\n     [4] So the young man, the young prophet, went to Ramoth Gilead.  [5] When he came, behold, the captains of the army were sitting. Then he said, “I have a message for you, captain.”\n    Jehu said, “To which one of us?”\n    He said, “To you, O captain.”  [6] He arose, and went into the house. Then He poured the oil on His head, and said to Him, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘I have anointed you king over the people of Yahweh, even over Israel.  [7] You must strike your master Ahab’s house, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of Yahweh, at the hand of Jezebel.  [8] For the whole house of Ahab will perish. I will cut off from Ahab everyone who urinates against a wall, both him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel.  [9] I will make Ahab’s house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah.  [10] The dogs will eat Jezebel on the plot of ground of Jezreel, and there shall be no one to bury her.’” Then he opened the door and fled.\n     [11] When Jehu came out to the servants of his lord and one said to him, “Is all well? Why did this madman come to you?”\n    He said to them, “You know the man and how he talks.”\n     [12] They said, “That is a lie. Tell us now.”\n    He said, “He said to me, ‘Yahweh says, I have anointed you king over Israel.’”\n     [13] Then they hurried, and each man took his cloak, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew the trumpet, saying, “Jehu is king.”\n     [14] So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram was defending Ramoth Gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria;  [15] but King Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) Jehu said, “If this is your thinking, then let no one escape and go out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel.”  [16] So Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram lay there. Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram.  [17] Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, “I see a company.”\n    Joram said, “Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, ‘Is it peace?’”\n     [18] So one went on horseback to meet him, and said, “the king says, ‘Is it peace?’”\n    Jehu said, “What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me!”\n    The watchman said, “The messenger came to them, but he isn’t coming back.”\n     [19] Then he sent out a second on horseback, who came to them and said, “The king says, ‘Is it peace?’”\n    Jehu answered, “What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me!”\n     [20] The watchman said, “He came to them, and isn’t coming back. The driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously.”\n     [21] Joram said, “Get ready!”\n    They got his chariot ready. Then Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot; and they went out to meet Jehu, and found him on Naboth the Jezreelite’s land.  [22] When Joram saw Jehu, he said, “Is it peace, Jehu?”\n    He answered, “What peace, so long as the prostitution of your mother Jezebel and her witchcraft abound?”\n     [23] Joram turned his hands and fled, and said to Ahaziah, “This is treason, Ahaziah!”\n     [24] Jehu drew his bow with his full strength, and struck Joram between his arms; and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.  [25] Then Jehu said to Bidkar His captain, “Pick Him up, and throw Him in the plot of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember how, when you and I rode together after Ahab His father, Yahweh laid this burden on Him:  [26] ‘Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of His sons,’ says Yahweh; ‘and I will repay you in this plot of ground,’ says Yahweh. Now therefore take and cast Him onto the plot of ground, according to Yahweh’s word.”\n     [27] But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. Jehu followed after him, and said, “Strike him also in the chariot!” They struck him at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. He fled to Megiddo, and died there.  [28] His servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in David’s city.  [29] In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab, Ahaziah began to reign over Judah.\n     [30] When Jehu had come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her eyes, and adorned her head, and looked out at the window.  [31] As Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, “Do you come in peace, Zimri, you murderer of your master?”\n     [32] He lifted up his face to the window, and said, “Who is on my side? Who?”\n    Two or three eunuchs looked out at him.\n     [33] He said, “Throw her down!”\n    So they threw her down; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses. Then he trampled her under foot.  [34] When he had come in, he ate and drank. Then he said, “See now to this cursed woman, and bury her; for she is a king’s daughter.”\n     [35] They went to bury her, but they found no more of her than the skull, the feet, and the palms of her hands.  [36] Therefore they came back, and told Him.\n    He said, “This is Yahweh’s word, which He spoke by His servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, ‘The dogs will eat the flesh of Jezebel on the plot of Jezreel,  [37] and the body of Jezebel will be as dung on the surface of the field on Jezreel’s land, so that they won’t say, “This is Jezebel.”’”\n"

          "content": "     [1] Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, even the elders, and to those who brought up Ahab’s sons, saying,  [2] “Now as soon as this letter comes to you, since your master’s sons are with you, and you have chariots and horses, a fortified city also, and armor,  [3] select the best and fittest of your master’s sons, set him on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house.”\n     [4] But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, “Behold, the two kings didn’t stand before him! How then shall we stand?”  [5] He who was over the household, and he who was over the city, the elders also, and those who raised the children, sent to Jehu, saying, “We are your servants, and will do all that you ask us. We will not make any man king. You do that which is good in your eyes.”\n     [6] Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, “If you are on my side, and if you will listen to my voice, take the heads of the men who are your master’s sons, and come to me to Jezreel by tomorrow this time.”\n    Now the king’s sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who brought them up.  [7] When the letter came to them, they took the king’s sons and killed them, even seventy people, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him to Jezreel.  [8] A messenger came and told him, “They have brought the heads of the king’s sons.”\n    He said, “Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.”  [9] In the morning, he went out and stood, and said to all the people, “You are righteous. Behold, I conspired against my master and killed him, but who killed all these?  [10] Know now that nothing will fall to the earth of Yahweh’s word, which Yahweh spoke concerning Ahab’s house. For Yahweh has done that which He spoke by His servant Elijah.”\n     [11] So Jehu struck all that remained of Ahab’s house in Jezreel, with all his great men, his familiar friends, and his priests, until he left him no one remaining.\n     [12] He arose and departed, and went to Samaria. As he was at the shearing house of the shepherds on the way,  [13] Jehu met with the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, “Who are you?”\n    They answered, “We are the brothers of Ahaziah. We are going down to greet the children of the king and the children of the queen.”\n     [14] He said, “Take them alive!”\n    They took them alive, and killed them at the pit of the shearing house, even forty-two men. He didn’t leave any of them.\n     [15] When he had departed from there, he met Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him. He greeted him, and said to him, “Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart?”\n    Jehonadab answered, “It is.”\n    “If it is, give me your hand.” He gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.  [16] He said, “Come with me, and see my zeal for Yahweh.” So they made Him ride in His chariot.  [17] When He came to Samaria, He struck all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, until He had destroyed them, according to Yahweh’s word which He spoke to Elijah.\n     [18] Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, “Ahab served Baal a little, but Jehu will serve him much.  [19] Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all of his worshipers, and all of his priests. Let no one be absent, for I have a great sacrifice to Baal. Whoever is absent, he shall not live.” But Jehu did deceptively, intending to destroy the worshipers of Baal.\n     [20] Jehu said, “Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal!”\n    So they proclaimed it.  [21] Jehu sent through all Israel; and all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that didn’t come. They came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to another.  [22] He said to him who kept the wardrobe, “Bring out robes for all the worshipers of Baal!”\n    So he brought robes out to them.  [23] Jehu went with Jehonadab the son of Rechab into the house of Baal. Then He said to the worshipers of Baal, “Search, and see that none of the servants of Yahweh are here with you, but only the worshipers of Baal.”\n     [24] So they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had appointed for himself eighty men outside, and said, “If any of the men whom I bring into your hands escape, he who lets him go, his life shall be for the life of him.”\n     [25] As soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, “Go in and kill them! Let no one escape.” So they struck them with the edge of the sword. The guard and the captains threw the bodies out, and went to the inner shrine of the house of Baal.  [26] They brought out the pillars that were in the house of Baal and burned them.  [27] They broke down the pillar of Baal, and broke down the house of Baal, and made it a latrine, to this day.  [28] Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.\n     [29] However, Jehu didn’t depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin—the golden calves that were in Bethel and that were in Dan.  [30] Yahweh said to Jehu, “Because you have done well in executing that which is right in my eyes, and have done to Ahab’s house according to all that was in my heart, your descendants shall sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation.”\n     [31] But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of Yahweh, the God of Israel, with all His heart. He didn’t depart from the sins of Jeroboam, with which He made Israel to sin.\n     [32] In those days Yahweh began to cut away parts of Israel; and Hazael struck them in all the borders of Israel  [33] from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.  [34] Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  [35] Jehu slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria. Jehoahaz his son reigned in his place.  [36] The time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.\n"

[2] But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king’s sons who were slain, even him and his nurse, and put them in the bedroom; and they hid him from Athaliah, so that he was not slain.  [3] He was with her hidden in Yahweh’s house six years while Athaliah reigned over the land.\n     [4] In the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the captains over hundreds of the Carites and of the guard, and brought them to Him into Yahweh’s house; and He made a covenant with them, and made a covenant with them in Yahweh’s house, and showed them the king’s son.  [5] He commanded them, saying, “This is what you must do: a third of you, who come in on the Sabbath, shall be keepers of the watch of the king’s house;  [6] a third of you shall be at the gate Sur; and a third of you at the gate behind the guard. So you shall keep the watch of the house, and be a barrier.  [7] The two companies of you, even all who go out on the Sabbath, shall keep the watch of Yahweh’s house around the king.  [8] You shall surround the king, every man with his weapons in his hand; and he who comes within the ranks, let him be slain. Be with the king when he goes out, and when he comes in.”\n     [9] The captains over hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded; and they each took his men, those who were to come in on the Sabbath with those who were to go out on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.  [10] The priest delivered to the captains over hundreds the spears and shields that had been King David’s, which were in Yahweh’s house.  [11] The guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, around the king.  [12] Then he brought out the king’s son, and put the crown on him, and gave him the covenant; and they made him king and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, “Long live the king!”\n     [13] When Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into Yahweh’s house;  [14] and she looked, and behold, the king stood by the pillar, as the tradition was, with the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her clothes and cried, “Treason! Treason!”\n     [15] Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to them, “Bring her out between the ranks. Kill anyone who follows her with the sword.” For the priest said, “Don’t let her be slain in Yahweh’s house.”  [16] So they seized her; and she went by the way of the horses’ entry to the king’s house, and she was slain there.\n     [17] Jehoiada made a covenant between Yahweh and the king and the people, that they should be Yahweh’s people; also between the king and the people.  [18] All the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and broke it down. They broke His altars and His images in pieces thoroughly, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. The priest appointed officers over Yahweh’s house.  [19] He took the captains over hundreds, and the Carites, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from Yahweh’s house, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king’s house. He sat on the throne of the kings.  [20] So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet.

[2] Jehoash did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes all His days in which Jehoiada the priest instructed Him.  [3] However, the high places were not taken away. The people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places.\n     [4] Jehoash said to the priests, “All the money of the holy things that is brought into Yahweh’s house, in current money, the money of the people for whom each man is evaluated, and all the money that it comes into any man’s heart to bring into Yahweh’s house,  [5] let the priests take it to them, each man from his donor; and they shall repair the damage to the house, wherever any damage is found.”\n     [6] But it was so, that in the twenty-third year of King Jehoash the priests had not repaired the damage to the house.  [7] Then King Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and for the other priests, and said to them, “Why aren’t you repairing the damage to the house? Now therefore take no more money from your treasurers, but deliver it for repair of the damage to the house.”\n     [8] The priests consented that they should take no more money from the people, and not repair the damage to the house.

[2] He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which He made Israel to sin. He didn’t depart from it.  [3] Yahweh’s anger burned against Israel, and He delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, continually.  [4] Jehoahaz begged Yahweh, and Yahweh listened to Him; for He saw the oppression of Israel, how the king of Syria oppressed them.

[6] Nevertheless they didn’t depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, with which he made Israel to sin, but walked in them; and the Asherah also remained in Samaria.)

[16] He said to the king of Israel, “Put your hand on the bow;” and he put his hand on it. Elisha laid his hands on the king’s hands.  [17] He said, “Open the window eastward;” and He opened it. Then Elisha said, “Shoot!” and He shot. He said, “Yahweh’s arrow of victory, even the arrow of victory over Syria; for you will strike the Syrians in Aphek until you have consumed them.”\n     [18] He said, “Take the arrows;” and he took them. He said to the king of Israel, “Strike the ground;” and he struck three times, and stopped.  [19] The man of God was angry with Him, and said, “You should have struck five or six times. Then you would have struck Syria until you had consumed it, but now you will strike Syria just three times.”\n     [20] Elisha died, and they buried him.\n    Now the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.

As soon as the man touched Elisha’s bones, he revived, and stood up on his feet.\n     [22] Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.  [23] But Yahweh was gracious to them, and had compassion on them, and favored them because of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them and He didn’t cast them from His presence as yet.\n     [24] Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in his place.  [25] Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Joash struck him three times, and recovered the cities of Israel.\n"

[2] He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem.  [3] He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, yet not like David His father. He did according to all that Joash His father had done.  [4] However the high places were not taken away. The people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places.  [5] As soon as the kingdom was established in his hand, he killed his servants who had slain the king his father,  [6] but the children of the murderers He didn’t put to death, according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, as Yahweh commanded, saying, “The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall die for His own sin.”\n     [7] He killed ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt, and took Sela by war, and called its name Joktheel, to this day.  [8] Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come, let’s look one another in the face.”\n     [9] Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, “The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son as wife.’ Then a wild animal that was in Lebanon passed by, and trampled down the thistle.  [10] You have indeed struck Edom, and your heart has lifted you up. Enjoy the glory of it, and stay at home; for why should you meddle to your harm, that you fall, even you, and Judah with you?”\n     [11] But Amaziah would not listen. So Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah.  [12] Judah was defeated by Israel; and each man fled to his tent.  [13] Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth Shemesh and came to Jerusalem, then broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.  [14] He took all the gold and silver and all the vessels that were found in Yahweh’s house and in the treasures of the king’s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.\n     [15] Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  [16] Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his place.\n     [17] Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel, fifteen years.  [18] Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?  [19] They made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there.  [20] They brought him on horses, and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in David’s city.\n     [21] All the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah.  [22] He built Elath and restored it to Judah. After that the king slept with his fathers.\n     [23] In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah, Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria for forty-one years.  [24] He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight. He didn’t depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which He made Israel to sin.  [25] He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath to the sea of the Arabah, according to Yahweh, the God of Israel’s word, which He spoke by His servant Jonah the son of Amittai, the prophet, who was from Gath Hepher.  [26] For Yahweh saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter for all, slave and free; and there was no helper for Israel.  [27] Yahweh didn’t say that He would blot out the name of Israel from under the sky; but He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.

[4] He sacrificed and burned incense in the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.\n     [5] Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to wage war. They besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.  [6] At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drove the Jews from Elath; and the Syrians came to Elath, and lived there to this day.  [7] So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria, saying, “I am your servant and your son. Come up and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria and out of the hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me.”  [8] Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in Yahweh’s house, and in the treasures of the king’s house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria.  [9] The king of Assyria listened to him; and the king of Assyria went up against Damascus and took it, and carried its people captive to Kir, and killed Rezin.\n     [10] King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria, and saw the altar that was at Damascus; and King Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest a drawing of the altar and plans to build it.  [11] Urijah the priest built an altar. According to all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus, so Urijah the priest made it for the coming of King Ahaz from Damascus.  [12] When the king had come from Damascus, the king saw the altar; and the king came near to the altar, and offered on it.  [13] He burned his burnt offering and his meal offering, poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings on the altar.  [14] The bronze altar, which was before Yahweh, He brought from the front of the house, from between His altar and Yahweh’s house, and put it on the north side of His altar.  [15] King Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, “On the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, the evening meal offering, the king’s burnt offering and his meal offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, their meal offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice; but the bronze altar will be for me to inquire by.”  [16] Urijah the priest did so, according to all that King Ahaz commanded.\n     [17] King Ahaz cut off the panels of the bases, and removed the basin from off them, and took down the sea from off the bronze oxen that were under it, and put it on a pavement of stone.

[2] He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, yet not as the kings of Israel who were before Him.  [3] Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against him; and Hoshea became his servant, and brought him tribute.  [4] The king of Assyria discovered a conspiracy in Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year. Therefore the king of Assyria seized him, and bound him in prison.  [5] Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.  [6] In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria and carried Israel away to Assyria, and placed them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.\n     [7] It was so because the children of Israel had sinned against Yahweh their God, who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,  [8] and walked in the statutes of the nations whom Yahweh cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they made.  [9] The children of Israel secretly did things that were not right against Yahweh their God; and they built high places for themselves in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city;  [10] and they set up for themselves pillars and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree;  [11] and there they burned incense in all the high places, as the nations whom Yahweh carried away before them did; and they did wicked things to provoke Yahweh to anger;  [12] and they served idols, of which Yahweh had said to them, “You shall not do this thing.”  [13] Yet Yahweh testified to Israel and to Judah, by every prophet and every seer, saying, “Turn from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.”  [14] Notwithstanding, they would not listen, but hardened their neck like the neck of their fathers who didn’t believe in Yahweh their God.  [15] They rejected His statutes and His covenant that He made with their fathers, and His testimonies which He testified to them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and followed the nations that were around them, concerning whom Yahweh had commanded them that they should not do like them.  [16] They abandoned all the commandments of Yahweh their God, and made molten images for themselves, even two calves, and made an Asherah, and worshiped all the army of the sky, and served Baal.  [17] They caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, to provoke Him to anger.  [18] Therefore Yahweh was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of His sight. There was none left but the tribe of Judah only.\n     [19] Also Judah didn’t keep the commandments of Yahweh their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.  [20] Yahweh rejected all the offspring of Israel, afflicted them, and delivered them into the hands of raiders, until He had cast them out of His sight.  [21] For He tore Israel from David’s house; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king; and Jeroboam drove Israel from following Yahweh, and made them sin a great sin.  [22] The children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they didn’t depart from them  [23] until Yahweh removed Israel out of His sight, as He said by all His servants the prophets. So Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria to this day.\n     [24] The king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, from Cuthah, from Avva, and from Hamath and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel; and they possessed Samaria and lived in its cities.  [25] So it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they didn’t fear Yahweh. Therefore Yahweh sent lions among them, which killed some of them.  [26] Therefore they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, “The nations which you have carried away and placed in the cities of Samaria don’t know the law of the god of the land. Therefore He has sent lions among them; and behold, they kill them, because they don’t know the law of the god of the land.”\n     [27] Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, “Carry there one of the priests whom you brought from there; and let Him go and dwell there, and let Him teach them the law of the god of the land.”\n     [28] So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and lived in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear Yahweh.\n     [29] However every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities in which they lived.  [30] The men of Babylon made Succoth Benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,  [31] and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.  [32] So they feared Yahweh, and also made from among themselves priests of the high places for themselves, who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.  [33] They feared Yahweh, and also served their own gods, after the ways of the nations from among whom they had been carried away.  [34] To this day they do what they did before. They don’t fear Yahweh, and they do not follow the statutes, or the ordinances, or the law, or the commandment which Yahweh commanded the children of Jacob, whom He named Israel;  [35] with whom Yahweh had made a covenant and commanded them, saying, “You shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them;  [36] but you shall fear Yahweh, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm, and you shall bow yourselves to Him, and you shall sacrifice to Him.  [37] The statutes and the ordinances, and the law and the commandment which he wrote for you, you shall observe to do forever more. You shall not fear other gods.  [38] You shall not forget the covenant that I have made with you. You shall not fear other gods.  [39] But you shall fear Yahweh your God, and He will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.”\n     [40] However they didn’t listen, but they did what they did before.  [41] So these nations feared Yahweh, and also served their engraved images. Their children did likewise, and so did their children’s children. They do as their fathers did to this day.\n"

[3] He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, according to all that David His father had done.  [4] He removed the high places, broke the pillars, and cut down the Asherah. He also broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made, because in those days the children of Israel burned incense to it; and he called it Nehushtan.  [5] He trusted in Yahweh, the God of Israel, so that after Him was no one like Him among all the kings of Judah, nor among them that were before Him.  [6] For He joined with Yahweh. He didn’t depart from following Him, but kept His commandments, which Yahweh commanded Moses.  [7] Yahweh was with Him. Wherever He went, He prospered. He rebelled against the king of Assyria, and didn’t serve Him.  [8] He struck the Philistines to Gaza and its borders, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city.\n     [9] In the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria and besieged it.  [10] At the end of three years they took it. In the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.  [11] The king of Assyria carried Israel away to Assyria, and put them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,  [12] because they didn’t obey Yahweh their God’s voice, but transgressed His covenant, even all that Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded, and would not hear it or do it.\n     [13] Now in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them.  [14] Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying, “I have offended you. Withdraw from me. That which you put on me, I will bear.” The king of Assyria appointed to Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.  [15] Hezekiah gave Him all the silver that was found in Yahweh’s house and in the treasures of the king’s house.  [16] At that time, Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of Yahweh’s temple, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.\n     [17] The king of Assyria sent Tartan, Rabsaris, and Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah with a great army to Jerusalem. They went up and came to Jerusalem. When they had come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller’s field.  [18] When they had called to the king, Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebnah the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder came out to them.  [19] Rabshakeh said to them, “Say now to Hezekiah, ‘The great king, the king of Assyria, says, “What confidence is this in which you trust?  [20] You say (but they are but vain words), ‘There is counsel and strength for war.’ Now on whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me?  [21] Now, behold, you trust in the staff of this bruised reed, even in Egypt. If a man leans on it, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust on him.  [22] But if you tell me, ‘We trust in Yahweh our God,’ isn’t that He whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, ‘You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?’  [23] Now therefore, please give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses if you are able on your part to set riders on them.  [24] How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?  [25] Have I now come up without Yahweh against this place to destroy it? Yahweh said to me, ‘Go up against this land, and destroy it.’”’”\n     [26] Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, Shebnah, and Joah, said to Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in the Syrian language, for we understand it. Don’t speak with us in the Jews’ language, in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.”\n     [27] But Rabshakeh said to them, “Has my master sent me to your master and to you, to speak these words? Hasn’t he sent me to the men who sit on the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own urine with you?”\n     [28] Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and spoke, saying, “Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria.  [29] The king says, ‘Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand.  [30] Don’t let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh, saying, “Yahweh will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.”  [31] Don’t listen to Hezekiah.’ For the king of Assyria says, ‘Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and everyone of you eat from his own vine, and everyone from his own fig tree, and everyone drink water from his own cistern;  [32] until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and of honey, that you may live and not die. Don’t listen to Hezekiah when He persuades you, saying, “Yahweh will deliver us.”  [33] Has any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?  [34] Where are the gods of Hamath and of Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?  [35] Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Yahweh should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?’”\n     [36] But the people stayed quiet, and answered him not a word; for the king’s commandment was, “Don’t answer him.”  [37] Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, came with Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him Rabshakeh’s words.\n"

[2] He sent Eliakim, who was over the household, Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.  [3] They said to him, “Hezekiah says, ‘Today is a day of trouble, of rebuke, and of rejection; for the children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to deliver them.  [4] It may be Yahweh your God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria His master has sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Yahweh your God has heard. Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.’”\n     [5] So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.  [6] Isaiah said to them, “Tell your master this: ‘Yahweh says, “Don’t be afraid of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.  [7] Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he will hear news, and will return to his own land. I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.”’”\n     [8] So Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish.  [9] When he heard it said of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, “Behold, he has come out to fight against you,” he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,  [10] “Tell Hezekiah king of Judah this: ‘Don’t let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.  [11] Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly. Will you be delivered?  [12] Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed—Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the children of Eden who were in Telassar?  [13] Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?’”\n     [14] Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it. Then Hezekiah went up to Yahweh’s house, and spread it before Yahweh.  [15] Hezekiah prayed before Yahweh, and said, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, who are enthroned above the cherubim, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth.  [16] Incline your ear, Yahweh, and hear. Open your eyes, Yahweh, and see. Hear the words of Sennacherib, which He has sent to defy the living God.  [17] Truly, Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands,  [18] and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone. Therefore they have destroyed them.  [19] Now therefore, Yahweh our God, save us, I beg you, out of His hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, Yahweh, are God alone.”\n     [20] Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says ‘You have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, and I have heard you.  [21] This is the word that Yahweh has spoken concerning Him: ‘The virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and ridiculed you. The daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.  [22] Whom have you defied and blasphemed? Against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel!  [23] By your messengers, you have defied the Lord, and have said, “With the multitude of my chariots, I have come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon, and I will cut down its tall cedars and its choice cypress trees; and I will enter into His farthest lodging place, the forest of His fruitful field.  [24] I have dug and drunk strange waters, and I will dry up all the rivers of Egypt with the sole of my feet.”  [25] Haven’t you heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? Now I have brought it to pass, that it should be yours to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps.  [26] Therefore their inhabitants had little power. They were dismayed and confounded. They were like the grass of the field and like the green herb, like the grass on the housetops and like grain blasted before it has grown up.  [27] But I know your sitting down, your going out, your coming in, and your raging against me.  [28] Because of your raging against me, and because your arrogance has come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in your nose, and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came.’\n     [29] “This will be the sign to you: This year, you will eat that which grows of itself, and in the second year that which springs from that; and in the third year sow and reap, and plant vineyards and eat their fruit.  [30] The remnant that has escaped of the house of Judah will again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.  [31] For out of Jerusalem a remnant will go out, and out of Mount Zion those who shall escape. Yahweh’s zeal will perform this.\n     [32] “Therefore Yahweh says concerning the king of Assyria, ‘He will not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow there. He will not come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.  [33] He will return the same way that He came, and He will not come to this city,’ says Yahweh.  [34] ‘For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake and for my servant David’s sake.’”\n     [35] That night, Yahweh’s angel went out and struck one hundred eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians. When men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.  [36] So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, went home, and lived at Nineveh.  [37] As He was worshiping in the house of Nisroch His god, Adrammelech and Sharezer struck Him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. Esar Haddon His son reigned in His place.\n"

Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to Him, and said to Him, “Yahweh says, ‘Set your house in order; for you will die, and not live.’”\n     [2] Then He turned His face to the wall, and prayed to Yahweh, saying,  [3] “Remember now, Yahweh, I beg you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly.\n     [4] Before Isaiah had gone out into the middle part of the city, Yahweh’s word came to Him, saying,  [5] “Turn back, and tell Hezekiah the prince of my people, ‘Yahweh, the God of David your father, says, “I have heard your prayer. I have seen your tears. Behold, I will heal you. On the third day, you will go up to Yahweh’s house.  [6] I will add to your days fifteen years. I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city for my own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.”’”\n     [7] Isaiah said, “Take a cake of figs.”\n    They took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.\n     [8] Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “What will be the sign that Yahweh will heal me, and that I will go up to Yahweh’s house the third day?”\n     [9] Isaiah said, “This will be the sign to you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will do the thing that He has spoken: should the shadow go forward ten steps, or go back ten steps?”\n     [10] Hezekiah answered, “It is a light thing for the shadow to go forward ten steps. No, but let the shadow return backward ten steps.”\n     [11] Isaiah the prophet cried to Yahweh; and He brought the shadow ten steps backward, by which it had gone down on the sundial of Ahaz.\n     [12] At that time Berodach Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.  [13] Hezekiah listened to them, and showed them all the storehouse of his precious things—the silver, the gold, the spices, and the precious oil, and the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures. There was nothing in his house, or in all his dominion, that Hezekiah didn’t show them.\n     [14] Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah, and said to him, “What did these men say? From where did they come to you?”\n    Hezekiah said, “They have come from a far country, even from Babylon.”\n     [15] He said, “What have they seen in your house?”\n    Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house. There is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.”\n     [16] Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear Yahweh’s word.  [17] ‘Behold, the days come that all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have laid up in store to this day, will be carried to Babylon. Nothing will be left,’ says Yahweh.  [18] ‘They will take away some of your sons who will issue from you, whom you will father; and they will be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.’”\n     [19] Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “Yahweh’s word which you have spoken is good.” He said moreover, “Isn’t it so, if peace and truth will be in my days?”\n     [20] Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made the pool, and the conduit, and brought water into the city, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

[3] For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he raised up altars for Baal, and made an Asherah, as Ahab king of Israel did, and worshiped all the army of the sky, and served them.  [4] He built altars in Yahweh’s house, of which Yahweh said, “I will put my name in Jerusalem.”  [5] He built altars for all the army of the sky in the two courts of Yahweh’s house.  [6] He made His son to pass through the fire, practiced sorcery, used enchantments, and dealt with those who had familiar spirits and with wizards. He did much evil in Yahweh’s sight, to provoke Him to anger.  [7] He set the engraved image of Asherah that He had made in the house of which Yahweh said to David and to Solomon His son, “In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever;  [8] I will not cause the feet of Israel to wander any more out of the land which I gave their fathers, if only they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.”  [9] But they didn’t listen, and Manasseh seduced them to do that which is evil more than the nations did whom Yahweh destroyed before the children of Israel.\n     [10] Yahweh spoke by His servants the prophets, saying,  [11] “Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations, and has done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, who were before him, and has also made Judah to sin with his idols;  [12] therefore Yahweh the God of Israel says, ‘Behold, I will bring such evil on Jerusalem and Judah that whoever hears of it, both His ears will tingle.

His mother’s name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.  [20] He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, as Manasseh His father did.  [21] He walked in all the ways that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshiped them;  [22] and He abandoned Yahweh, the God of His fathers, and didn’t walk in the way of Yahweh.

[2] He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, and walked in all the way of David His father, and didn’t turn away to the right hand or to the left.\n     [3] In the eighteenth year of King Josiah, the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to Yahweh’s house, saying,  [4] “Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that He may count the money which is brought into Yahweh’s house, which the keepers of the threshold have gathered of the people.  [5] Let them deliver it into the hand of the workers who have the oversight of Yahweh’s house; and let them give it to the workers who are in Yahweh’s house, to repair the damage to the house,  [6] to the carpenters, and to the builders, and to the masons, and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the house.  [7] However, no accounting shall be asked of them for the money delivered into their hand, for they deal faithfully.”\n     [8] Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the book of the law in Yahweh’s house.” Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan, and He read it.  [9] Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, “Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hands of the workmen who have the oversight of Yahweh’s house.”  [10] Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, “Hilkiah the priest has delivered a book to me.” Then Shaphan read it before the king.\n     [11] When the king had heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes.  [12] The king commanded Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Achbor the son of Micaiah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying,  [13] “Go inquire of Yahweh for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found; for great is Yahweh’s wrath that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not listened to the words of this book, to do according to all that which is written concerning us.”\n     [14] So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter); and they talked with her.  [15] She said to them, “Yahweh the God of Israel says, ‘Tell the man who sent you to me,  [16] “Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will bring evil on this place and on its inhabitants, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read.  [17] Because they have forsaken me and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and it will not be quenched.’”  [18] But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Yahweh, tell Him, “Yahweh the God of Israel says, ‘Concerning the words which you have heard,  [19] because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before Yahweh when you heard what I spoke against this place and against its inhabitants, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and have torn your clothes and wept before me, I also have heard you,’ says Yahweh.

Your eyes will not see all the evil which I will bring on this place.’”’” So they brought this message back to the king.\n"

[2] The king went up to Yahweh’s house, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with Him—with the priests, the prophets, and all the people, both small and great; and He read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in Yahweh’s house.  [3] The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before Yahweh to walk after Yahweh and to keep His commandments, His testimonies, and His statutes with all His heart and all His soul, to confirm the words of this covenant that were written in this book; and all the people agreed to the covenant.\n     [4] The king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the threshold, to bring out of Yahweh’s temple all the vessels that were made for Baal, for the Asherah, and for all the army of the sky; and He burned them outside of Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and carried their ashes to Bethel.  [5] He got rid of the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah and in the places around Jerusalem; those also who burned incense to Baal, to the sun, to the moon, to the planets, and to all the army of the sky.  [6] He brought out the Asherah from Yahweh’s house, outside of Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and beat it to dust, and cast its dust on the graves of the common people.  [7] He broke down the houses of the male shrine prostitutes that were in Yahweh’s house, where the women wove hangings for the Asherah.  [8] He brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba; and he broke down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man’s left hand at the gate of the city.  [9] Nevertheless the priests of the high places didn’t come up to Yahweh’s altar in Jerusalem, but they ate unleavened bread among their brothers.  [10] He defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.  [11] He took away the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun, at the entrance of Yahweh’s house, by the room of Nathan Melech the officer who was in the court; and He burned the chariots of the sun with fire.  [12] The king broke down the altars that were on the roof of the upper room of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of Yahweh’s house, and beat them down from there, and cast their dust into the brook Kidron.  [13] The king defiled the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mountain of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon.  [14] He broke in pieces the pillars, cut down the Asherah poles, and filled their places with men’s bones.\n     [15] Moreover the altar that was at Bethel and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, even that altar and the high place he broke down; and he burned the high place and beat it to dust, and burned the Asherah.  [16] As Josiah turned Himself, He spied the tombs that were there in the mountain; and He sent, and took the bones out of the tombs, and burned them on the altar, and defiled it, according to Yahweh’s word which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these things.  [17] Then He said, “What monument is that which I see?”\n    The men of the city told Him, “It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and proclaimed these things that you have done against the altar of Bethel.”\n     [18] He said, “Let him be! Let no one move his bones.” So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet who came out of Samaria.  [19] All the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke Yahweh to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that He had done in Bethel.  [20] He killed all the priests of the high places that were there, on the altars, and burned men’s bones on them; and he returned to Jerusalem.\n     [21] The king commanded all the people, saying, “Keep the Passover to Yahweh your God, as it is written in this book of the covenant.”  [22] Surely there was not kept such a Passover from the days of the judges who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;  [23] but in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, this Passover was kept to Yahweh in Jerusalem.\n     [24] Moreover, Josiah removed those who had familiar spirits, the wizards, and the teraphim, and the idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, that He might confirm the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in Yahweh’s house.  [25] There was no king like Him before Him, who turned to Yahweh with all His heart, and with all His soul, and with all His might, according to all the law of Moses; and there was none like Him who arose after Him.  [26] Notwithstanding, Yahweh didn’t turn from the fierceness of His great wrath, with which His anger burned against Judah, because of all the provocation with which Manasseh had provoked Him.  [27] Yahweh said, “I will also remove Judah out of my sight, as I have removed Israel; and I will cast off this city which I have chosen, even Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, ‘My name shall be there.’”\n     [28] Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?  [29] In his days Pharaoh Necoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates; and King Josiah went against him, but Pharaoh Necoh killed him at Megiddo when he saw him.  [30] His servants carried him dead in a chariot from Megiddo, brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own tomb. The people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father’s place.\n     [31] Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.  [32] He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, according to all that His fathers had done.  [33] Pharaoh Necoh put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.  [34] Pharaoh Necoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the place of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim; but he took Jehoahaz away, and he came to Egypt and died there.  [35] Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh. He exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, from everyone according to his assessment, to give it to Pharaoh Necoh.  [36] Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.

[4] Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s garden (now the Chaldeans were against the city around it); and the king went by the way of the Arabah.  [5] But the Chaldean army pursued the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.  [6] Then they captured the king and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they passed judgment on him.  [7] They killed Zedekiah’s sons before his eyes, then put out Zedekiah’s eyes, bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon.\n     [8] Now in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.  [9] He burned Yahweh’s house, the king’s house, and all the houses of Jerusalem. He burned every great house with fire.  [10] All the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls around Jerusalem.  [11] Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive the rest of the people who were left in the city and those who had deserted to the king of Babylon—all the rest of the multitude.  [12] But the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to work the vineyards and fields.\n     [13] The Chaldeans broke up the pillars of bronze that were in Yahweh’s house and the bases and the bronze sea that were in Yahweh’s house, and carried the bronze pieces to Babylon.  [14] They took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the spoons, and all the vessels of bronze with which they ministered.  [15] The captain of the guard took away the fire pans, the basins, that which was of gold, for gold, and that which was of silver, for silver.  [16] The two pillars, the one sea, and the bases, which Solomon had made for Yahweh’s house, the bronze of all these vessels was not weighed.  [17] The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a capital of bronze was on it. The height of the capital was three cubits, with network and pomegranates on the capital around it, all of bronze; and the second pillar with its network was like these.\n     [18] The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold;  [19] and out of the city he took an officer who was set over the men of war; and five men of those who saw the king’s face, who were found in the city; and the scribe, the captain of the army, who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the city.  [20] Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.  [21] The king of Babylon attacked them and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land.\n     [22] As for the people who were left in the land of Judah whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor.  [23] Now when all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan the son of Kareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.  [24] Gedaliah swore to them and to their men, and said to them, “Don’t be afraid because of the servants of the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you.”\n     [25] But in the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal offspring came, and ten men with him, and struck Gedaliah so that he died, with the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him at Mizpah.  [26] All the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces arose and came to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.  [27] In the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, Evilmerodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, released Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison,  [28] and he spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon,  [29] and changed his prison garments. Jehoiachin ate bread before him continually all the days of his life;  [30] and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him from the king, every day a portion, all the days of his life.\n"

[25] They trespassed against the God of their fathers, and played the prostitute after the gods of the peoples of the land whom God destroyed before them.  [26] So the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgath Pilneser king of Assyria, and He carried away the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah, Habor, Hara, and to the river of Gozan, to this day.\n"

[9] David grew greater and greater, for Yahweh of Armies was with Him.\n     [10] Now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who showed themselves strong with Him in His kingdom, together with all Israel, to make Him king, according to Yahweh’s word concerning Israel.\n     [11] This is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them at one time.  [12] After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.  [13] He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where there was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.  [14] They stood in the middle of the plot, defended it, and killed the Philistines; and Yahweh saved them by a great victory.\n     [15] Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the army of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim.  [16] David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was in Bethlehem at that time.  [17] David longed, and said, “Oh, that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!”\n     [18] The three broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate, took it, and brought it to David; but David would not drink any of it, but poured it out to Yahweh,  [19] and said, “My God forbid me, that I should do this! Shall I drink the blood of these men who have put their lives in jeopardy?” For they risked their lives to bring it. Therefore He would not drink it. The three mighty men did these things.\n     [20] Abishai, the brother of Joab, was chief of the three; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them, and had a name among the three.  [21] Of the three, he was more honorable than the two, and was made their captain; however he wasn’t included in the three.\n     [22] Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in the middle of a pit on a snowy day.  [23] He killed an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high. In the Egyptian’s hand was a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and killed him with his own spear.  [24] Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did these things and had a name among the three mighty men.  [25] Behold, he was more honorable than the thirty, but he didn’t attain to the three; and David set him over his guard.\n     [26] The mighty men of the armies also include Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,  [27] Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,  [28] Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite,  [29] Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,  [30] Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite,  [31] Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,  [32] Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,  [33] Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,  [34] the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shagee the Hararite,  [35] Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,  [36] Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,  [37] Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai,  [38] Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Hagri,  [39] Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite (the armor bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah),  [40] Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,  [41] Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,  [42] Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite (a chief of the Reubenites), and thirty with him,  [43] Hanan the son of Maacah, Joshaphat the Mithnite,  [44] Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite,  [45] Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,  [46] Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,  [47] Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.\n"

[2] They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in slinging stones and in shooting arrows from the bow. They were of Saul’s relatives of the tribe of Benjamin.  [3] The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; Beracah; Jehu the Anathothite;  [4] Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty and a leader of the thirty; Jeremiah; Jahaziel; Johanan; Jozabad the Gederathite;  [5] Eluzai; Jerimoth; Bealiah; Shemariah; Shephatiah the Haruphite;  [6] Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites;  [7] and Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.\n     [8] Some Gadites joined David in the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty men of valor, men trained for war, who could handle shield and spear; whose faces were like the faces of lions, and they were as swift as the gazelles on the mountains:  [9] Ezer the chief, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,  [10] Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,  [11] Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,  [12] Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,  [13] Jeremiah the tenth, and Machbannai the eleventh.  [14] These of the sons of Gad were captains of the army. He who was least was equal to one hundred, and the greatest to one thousand.  [15] These are those who went over the Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all its banks; and they put to flight all who lived in the valleys, both toward the east and toward the west.\n     [16] Some of the children of Benjamin and Judah came to the stronghold to David.  [17] David went out to meet them, and answered them, “If you have come peaceably to me to help me, my heart will be united with you; but if you have come to betray me to my adversaries, since there is no wrong in my hands, may the God of our fathers see this and rebuke it.”  [18] Then the Spirit came on Amasai, who was chief of the thirty, and He said, “We are yours, David, and on your side, you son of Jesse. Peace, peace be to you, and peace be to your helpers; for your God helps you.” Then David received them and made them captains of the band.\n     [19] Some of Manasseh also joined David when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle, but they didn’t help them, for the lords of the Philistines sent him away after consultation, saying, “He will desert to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.”\n     [20] As he went to Ziklag, some from Manasseh joined him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands who were of Manasseh.  [21] They helped David against the band of raiders, for they were all mighty men of valor and were captains in the army.  [22] For from day to day men came to David to help Him, until there was a great army, like God’s army.\n     [23] These are the numbers of the heads of those who were armed for war, who came to David to Hebron to turn the kingdom of Saul to Him, according to Yahweh’s word.  [24] The children of Judah who bore shield and spear were six thousand eight hundred, armed for war.  [25] Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valor for the war: seven thousand one hundred.  [26] Of the children of Levi: four thousand six hundred.  [27] Jehoiada was the leader of the household of Aaron; and with him were three thousand seven hundred,  [28] and Zadok, a young man mighty of valor, and of his father’s house twenty-two captains.  [29] Of the children of Benjamin, Saul’s relatives: three thousand, for until then, the greatest part of them had kept their allegiance to Saul’s house.  [30] Of the children of Ephraim: twenty thousand eight hundred, mighty men of valor, famous men in their fathers’ houses.  [31] Of the half-tribe of Manasseh: eighteen thousand, who were mentioned by name, to come and make David king.  [32] Of the children of Issachar, men who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do, their heads were two hundred; and all their brothers were at their command.  [33] Of Zebulun, such as were able to go out in the army, who could set the battle in array with all kinds of instruments of war: fifty thousand who could command and were not of double heart.  [34] Of Naphtali: one thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty-seven thousand.  [35] Of the Danites who could set the battle in array: twenty-eight thousand six hundred.  [36] Of Asher, such as were able to go out in the army, who could set the battle in array: forty thousand.  [37] On the other side of the Jordan, of the Reubenites, the Gadites, and of the half-tribe of Manasseh, with all kinds of instruments of war for the battle: one hundred twenty thousand.\n     [38] All these were men of war who could order the battle array, and came with a perfect heart to Hebron to make David king over all Israel; and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king.  [39] They were there with David three days, eating and drinking; for their brothers had supplied provisions for them.  [40] Moreover those who were near to them, as far as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali, brought bread on donkeys, on camels, on mules, and on oxen: supplies of flour, cakes of figs, clusters of raisins, wine, oil, cattle, and sheep in abundance; for there was joy in Israel.\n"

[3] Also, let’s bring the ark of our God back to us again, for we didn’t seek it in the days of Saul.”\n     [4] All the assembly said that they would do so, for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.  [5] So David assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor River of Egypt even to the entrance of Hamath, to bring God’s ark from Kiriath Jearim.\n     [6] David went up with all Israel to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath Jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from there God Yahweh’s ark that sits above the cherubim, that is called by the Name.  [7] They carried God’s ark on a new cart, and brought it out of Abinadab’s house; and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.  [8] David and all Israel played before God with all their might, even with songs, with harps, with stringed instruments, with tambourines, with cymbals, and with trumpets.\n     [9] When they came to Chidon’s threshing floor, Uzza put out his hand to hold the ark, for the oxen stumbled.  [10] Yahweh’s anger burned against Uzza, and He struck Him because He put His hand on the ark; and He died there before God.  [11] David was displeased, because Yahweh had broken out against Uzza. He called that place Perez Uzza, to this day.  [12] David was afraid of God that day, saying, “How can I bring God’s ark home to me?”  [13] So David didn’t move the ark with him into David’s city, but carried it aside into Obed-Edom the Gittite’s house.  [14] God’s ark remained with the family of Obed-Edom in His house three months; and Yahweh blessed Obed-Edom’s house and all that He had.\n"

Will you deliver them into my hand?”\n    Yahweh said to Him, “Go up; for I will deliver them into your hand.”\n     [11] So they came up to Baal Perazim, and David defeated them there.

[2] Then David said, “No one ought to carry God’s ark but the Levites. For Yahweh has chosen them to carry God’s ark, and to minister to Him forever.”\n     [3] David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up Yahweh’s ark to its place, which He had prepared for it.  [4] David gathered together the sons of Aaron and the Levites:  [5] of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and his brothers one hundred twenty;  [6] of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and his brothers two hundred twenty;  [7] of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and his brothers one hundred thirty;  [8] of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and his brothers two hundred;  [9] of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and his brothers eighty;  [10] of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and his brothers one hundred twelve.\n     [11] David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites: for Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab,  [12] and said to them, “You are the heads of the fathers’ households of the Levites. Sanctify yourselves, both you and your brothers, that you may bring the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel, up to the place that I have prepared for it.  [13] For because you didn’t carry it at first, Yahweh our God broke out in anger against us, because we didn’t seek Him according to the ordinance.”\n     [14] So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel.  [15] The children of the Levites bore God’s ark on their shoulders with its poles, as Moses commanded according to Yahweh’s word.\n     [16] David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brothers as singers with instruments of music, stringed instruments, harps, and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up their voices with joy.  [17] So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brothers, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brothers, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;  [18] and with them their brothers of the second rank: Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers.  [19] So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were given cymbals of bronze to sound aloud;  [20] and Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with stringed instruments set to Alamoth;  [21] and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps tuned to the eight-stringed lyre, to lead.  [22] Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was over the singing. He taught the singers, because he was skillful.  [23] Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.  [24] Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, blew the trumpets before God’s ark; and Obed-Edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.\n     [25] So David, the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands went to bring the ark of Yahweh’s covenant up out of the house of Obed-Edom with joy.  [26] When God helped the Levites who bore the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.  [27] David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who bore the ark, the singers, and Chenaniah the choir master with the singers; and David had an ephod of linen on him.  [28] Thus all Israel brought the ark of Yahweh’s covenant up with shouting, with sound of the cornet, with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding aloud with stringed instruments and harps.  [29] As the ark of Yahweh’s covenant came to David’s city, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David dancing and playing; and she despised Him in her heart.\n"

[6] In all places in which I have walked with all Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, ‘Why have you not built me a house of cedar?’”’\n     [7] “Now therefore, you shall tell my servant David, ‘Yahweh of Armies says, “I took you from the sheep pen, from following the sheep, to be prince over my people Israel.  [8] I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you. I will make you a name like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.

The children of wickedness will not waste them any more, as at the first,  [10] and from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I tell you that Yahweh will build you a house.

[19] Yahweh, for your servant’s sake, and according to your own heart, you have done all this greatness, to make known all these great things.  [20] Yahweh, there is no one like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.  [21] What one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to Himself for a people, to make you a name by great and awesome things, in driving out nations from before your people whom you redeemed out of Egypt?  [22] For you made your people Israel your own people forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God.  [23] Now, Yahweh, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning His house, be established forever, and do as you have spoken.  [24] Let your name be established and magnified forever, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel. The house of David your servant is established before you.’  [25] For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build Him a house.

David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun to comfort him.  [3] But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, “Do you think that David honors your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Haven’t his servants come to you to search, to overthrow, and to spy out the land?”  [4] So Hanun took David’s servants, shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle at their buttocks, and sent them away.

The king said, “Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.”\n     [6] When the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent one thousand talents of silver to hire chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, out of Aram-maacah, and out of Zobah.

But, my lord the king, aren’t they all my lord’s servants? Why does my lord require this thing? Why will He be a cause of guilt to Israel?”\n     [4] Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed and went throughout all Israel, then came to Jerusalem.

All those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew a sword; and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew a sword.  [6] But he didn’t count Levi and Benjamin among them, for the king’s word was abominable to Joab.\n     [7] God was displeased with this thing; therefore He struck Israel.  [8] David said to God, “I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing. But now put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant, for I have done very foolishly.”\n     [9] Yahweh spoke to Gad, David’s seer, saying,  [10] “Go and speak to David, saying, ‘Yahweh says, “I offer you three things. Choose one of them, that I may do it to you.”’”\n     [11] So Gad came to David and said to Him, “Yahweh says, ‘Take your choice:  [12] either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or else three days of the sword of Yahweh, even pestilence in the land, and Yahweh’s angel destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to Him who sent me.’”\n     [13] David said to Gad, “I am in distress. Let me fall, I pray, into Yahweh’s hand, for His mercies are very great. Don’t let me fall into man’s hand.”\n     [14] So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell.  [15] God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it.

Now withdraw your hand.” Yahweh’s angel was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.  [16] David lifted up His eyes, and saw Yahweh’s angel standing between earth and the sky, having a drawn sword in His hand stretched out over Jerusalem.\n    Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.  [17] David said to God, “Isn’t it I who commanded the people to be counted? It is even I who have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O Yahweh my God, be against me and against my father’s house; but not against your people, that they should be plagued.”\n     [18] Then Yahweh’s angel commanded Gad to tell David that David should go up and raise an altar to Yahweh on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.  [19] David went up at the saying of Gad, which He spoke in Yahweh’s name.\n     [20] Ornan turned back and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.  [21] As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.\n     [22] Then David said to Ornan, “Sell me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar to Yahweh on it. You shall sell it to me for the full price, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people.”\n     [23] Ornan said to David, “Take it for yourself, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes. Behold, I give the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering. I give it all.”\n     [24] King David said to Ornan, “No, but I will most certainly buy it for the full price. For I will not take that which is yours for Yahweh, nor offer a burnt offering that costs me nothing.”\n     [25] So David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place.  [26] David built an altar to Yahweh there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on Yahweh; and He answered Him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering.\n     [27] Then Yahweh commanded the angel, and He put His sword back into its sheath.\n     [28] At that time, when David saw that Yahweh had answered Him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then He sacrificed there.  [29] For Yahweh’s tabernacle, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.

[14] Now, behold, in my affliction I have prepared for Yahweh’s house one hundred thousand talents of gold, one million talents of silver, and bronze and iron without weight; for it is in abundance. I have also prepared timber and stone; and you may add to them.  [15] There are also workmen with you in abundance—cutters and workers of stone and timber, and all kinds of men who are skillful in every kind of work;  [16] of the gold, the silver, the bronze, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and may Yahweh be with you.”\n     [17] David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,  [18] “Isn’t Yahweh your God with you? Hasn’t He given you rest on every side? For He has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before Yahweh and before His people.

[8] All these were of the sons of Obed-Edom with their sons and their brothers, able men in strength for the service: sixty-two of Obed-Edom.  [9] Meshelemiah had sons and brothers, eighteen valiant men.  [10] Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons: Shimri the chief (for though he was not the firstborn, yet his father made him chief),  [11] Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, and Zechariah the fourth. All the sons and brothers of Hosah were thirteen.\n     [12] Of these were the divisions of the doorkeepers, even of the chief men, having offices like their brothers, to minister in Yahweh’s house.  [13] They cast lots, the small as well as the great, according to their fathers’ houses, for every gate.  [14] The lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his son, a wise counselor, they cast lots; and his lot came out northward.  [15] To Obed-Edom southward; and to his sons the storehouse.  [16] To Shuppim and Hosah westward, by the gate of Shallecheth, at the causeway that goes up, watchman opposite watchman.  [17] Eastward were six Levites, northward four a day, southward four a day, and for the storehouse two and two.  [18] For Parbar westward, four at the causeway, and two at Parbar.  [19] These were the divisions of the doorkeepers; of the sons of the Korahites, and of the sons of Merari.\n     [20] Of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasures of God’s house and over the treasures of the dedicated things.  [21] The sons of Ladan, the sons of the Gershonites belonging to Ladan, the heads of the fathers’ households belonging to Ladan the Gershonite: Jehieli.  [22] The sons of Jehieli: Zetham, and Joel His brother, over the treasures of Yahweh’s house.  [23] Of the Amramites, of the Izharites, of the Hebronites, of the Uzzielites:  [24] Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was ruler over the treasuries.  [25] His brothers: of Eliezer, Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his son, and Joram his son, and Zichri his son, and Shelomoth his son.  [26] This Shelomoth and his brothers were over all the treasuries of the dedicated things, which David the king, and the heads of the fathers’ households, the captains over thousands and hundreds, and the captains of the army, had dedicated.  [27] They dedicated some of the plunder won in battles to repair Yahweh’s house.  [28] All that Samuel the seer, Saul the son of Kish, Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah had dedicated, whoever had dedicated anything, it was under the hand of Shelomoth and of his brothers.\n     [29] Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were appointed to the outward business over Israel, for officers and judges.  [30] Of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and His brothers, one thousand seven hundred men of valor, had the oversight of Israel beyond the Jordan westward, for all the business of Yahweh and for the service of the king.  [31] Of the Hebronites, Jerijah was the chief of the Hebronites, according to their generations by fathers’ households. They were sought for in the fortieth year of the reign of David, and mighty men of valor were found among them at Jazer of Gilead.  [32] His relatives, men of valor, were two thousand seven hundred, heads of fathers’ households, whom King David made overseers over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of the Manassites, for every matter pertaining to God and for the affairs of the king.\n"

[2] Then David the king stood up on His feet and said, “Hear me, my brothers and my people! As for me, it was in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, and for the footstool of our God; and I had prepared for the building.  [3] But God said to me, ‘You shall not build a house for my name, because you are a man of war and have shed blood.’  [4] However Yahweh, the God of Israel, chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever. For He has chosen Judah to be prince; and in the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father He took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel.  [5] Of all my sons (for Yahweh has given me many sons), He has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of Yahweh’s kingdom over Israel.  [6] He said to me, ‘Solomon, your son, shall build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.  [7] I will establish his kingdom forever if he continues to do my commandments and my ordinances, as it is today.’\n     [8] Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, Yahweh’s assembly, and in the audience of our God, observe and seek out all the commandments of Yahweh your God, that you may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children after you forever.\n     [9] You, Solomon my son, know the God of your father, and serve Him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for Yahweh searches all hearts, and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts. If you seek Him, He will be found by you; but if you forsake Him, He will cast you off forever.  [10] Take heed now, for Yahweh has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary. Be strong, and do it.”\n     [11] Then David gave to Solomon his son the plans for the porch of the temple, for its houses, for its treasuries, for its upper rooms, for its inner rooms, for the place of the mercy seat;  [12] and the plans of all that He had by the Spirit, for the courts of Yahweh’s house, for all the surrounding rooms, for the treasuries of God’s house, and for the treasuries of the dedicated things;  [13] also for the divisions of the priests and the Levites, for all the work of the service of Yahweh’s house, and for all the vessels of service in Yahweh’s house—  [14] of gold by weight for the gold for all vessels of every kind of service, for all the vessels of silver by weight, for all vessels of every kind of service;  [15] by weight also for the lamp stands of gold, and for its lamps, of gold, by weight for every lamp stand and for its lamps; and for the lamp stands of silver, by weight for every lamp stand and for its lamps, according to the use of every lamp stand;  [16] and the gold by weight for the tables of show bread, for every table; and silver for the tables of silver;  [17] and the forks, the basins, and the cups, of pure gold; and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl; and for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl;  [18] and for the altar of incense, refined gold by weight; and gold for the plans for the chariot, and the cherubim that spread out and cover the ark of Yahweh’s covenant.  [19] “All this”, David said, “I have been made to understand in writing from Yahweh’s hand, even all the works of this pattern.”\n     [20] David said to Solomon His son, “Be strong and courageous, and do it. Don’t be afraid, nor be dismayed, for Yahweh God, even my God, is with you. He will not fail you nor forsake you, until all the work for the service of Yahweh’s house is finished.  [21] Behold, there are the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service of God’s house. Every willing man who has skill for any kind of service shall be with you in all kinds of work.

[2] Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for the things of gold, the silver for the things of silver, the bronze for the things of bronze, iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood, also onyx stones, stones to be set, stones for inlaid work of various colors, all kinds of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.  [3] In addition, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, since I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, I give it to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house:  [4] even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, with which to overlay the walls of the houses;  [5] of gold for the things of gold, and of silver for the things of silver, and for all kinds of work to be made by the hands of artisans. Who then offers willingly to consecrate Himself today to Yahweh?”\n     [6] Then the princes of the fathers’ households, and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king’s work, offered willingly;  [7] and they gave for the service of God’s house of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, of silver ten thousand talents, of bronze eighteen thousand talents, and of iron one hundred thousand talents.  [8] People with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of Yahweh’s house, under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.  [9] Then the people rejoiced, because they offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Yahweh; and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.\n     [10] Therefore David blessed Yahweh before all the assembly; and David said, “You are blessed, Yahweh, the God of Israel our father, forever and ever.  [11] Yours, Yahweh, is the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and the majesty! For all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, Yahweh, and you are exalted as head above all.  [12] Both riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all! In your hand is power and might! It is in your hand to make great, and to give strength to all!  [13] Now therefore, our God, we thank you and praise your glorious name.  [14] But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly as this? For all things come from you, and we have given you of your own.  [15] For we are strangers before you and foreigners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no remaining.  [16] Yahweh our God, all this store that we have prepared to build you a house for your holy name comes from your hand, and is all your own.  [17] I know also, my God, that you try the heart and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things. Now I have seen with joy your people, who are present here, offer willingly to you.  [18] Yahweh, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this desire forever in the thoughts of the heart of your people, and prepare their heart for you;  [19] and give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made provision.”\n     [20] Then David said to all the assembly, “Now bless Yahweh your God!”\n    All the assembly blessed Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads and prostrated themselves before Yahweh and the king.  [21] They sacrificed sacrifices to Yahweh and offered burnt offerings to Yahweh on the next day after that day, even one thousand bulls, one thousand rams, and one thousand lambs, with their drink offerings and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel,  [22] and ate and drank before Yahweh on that day with great gladness. They made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed Him before Yahweh to be prince, and Zadok to be priest.\n     [23] Then Solomon sat on the throne of Yahweh as king instead of David His father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed Him.  [24] All the princes, the mighty men, and also all of the sons of King David submitted themselves to Solomon the king.  [25] Yahweh magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and gave to Him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before Him in Israel.\n     [26] Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.  [27] The time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem.  [28] He died at a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor; and Solomon his son reigned in his place.  [29] Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer,  [30] with all his reign and his might, and the events that involved him, Israel, and all the kingdoms of the lands.\n"

[3] Then Solomon, and all the assembly with Him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for God’s Tent of Meeting was there, which Yahweh’s servant Moses had made in the wilderness.  [4] But David had brought God’s ark up from Kiriath Jearim to the place that David had prepared for it; for He had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.  [5] Moreover the bronze altar that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made was there before Yahweh’s tabernacle; and Solomon and the assembly were seeking counsel there.  [6] Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before Yahweh, which was at the Tent of Meeting, and offered one thousand burnt offerings on it.\n     [7] That night, God appeared to Solomon and said to Him, “Ask for what you want me to give you.”\n     [8] Solomon said to God, “You have shown great loving kindness to David my father, and have made me king in His place.  [9] Now, Yahweh God, let your promise to David my father be established; for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.  [10] Now give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this great people of yours?”\n     [11] God said to Solomon, “Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches, wealth, honor, or the life of those who hate you, nor yet have you asked for long life; but have asked for wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge my people, over whom I have made you king,  [12] therefore wisdom and knowledge is granted to you. I will give you riches, wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had who have been before you, and none after you will have.”\n     [13] So Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the Tent of Meeting, to Jerusalem; and he reigned over Israel.\n     [14] Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen. He had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen that he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.  [15] The king made silver and gold to be as common as stones in Jerusalem, and he made cedars to be as common as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland.  [16] The horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt and from Kue. The king’s merchants purchased them from Kue.  [17] They imported from Egypt then exported a chariot for six hundred pieces of silver and a horse for one hundred fifty. They also exported them to the Hittite kings and the Syrian kings.\n"

[4] Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of Yahweh my God, to dedicate it to Him, to burn before Him incense of sweet spices, for the continual show bread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts of Yahweh our God.

Behold, my servants will be with your servants,  [9] even to prepare me timber in abundance; for the house which I am about to build will be great and wonderful.  [10] Behold, I will give to your servants, the cutters who cut timber, twenty thousand cors of beaten wheat, twenty thousand baths of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.”\n     [11] Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which He sent to Solomon, “Because Yahweh loves His people, He has made you king over them.”  [12] Huram continued, “Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, who has given to David the king a wise son, endowed with discretion and understanding, who would build a house for Yahweh and a house for His kingdom.\n     [13] Now I have sent a skillful man, endowed with understanding, Huram-abi,  [14] the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan; and his father was a man of Tyre. He is skillful to work in gold, in silver, in bronze, in iron, in stone, in timber, in purple, in blue, in fine linen, and in crimson, also to engrave any kind of engraving and to devise any device, that there may be a place appointed to him with your skillful men, and with the skillful men of my lord David your father.\n     [15] “Now therefore, the wheat, the barley, the oil, and the wine which my lord has spoken of, let him send to his servants;  [16] and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as you need. We will bring it to you in rafts by sea to Joppa; then you shall carry it up to Jerusalem.”\n     [17] Solomon counted all the foreigners who were in the land of Israel, after the census with which David his father had counted them; and they found one hundred fifty-three thousand six hundred.

[10] He set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.\n     [11] Huram made the pots, the shovels, and the basins.\n    So Huram finished doing the work that He did for King Solomon in God’s house:  [12] the two pillars, the bowls, the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars, the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars,  [13] and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks—two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars.  [14] He also made the bases, and he made the basins on the bases—  [15] one sea, and the twelve oxen under it.  [16] Huram-abi also made the pots, the shovels, the forks, and all its vessels for King Solomon, for Yahweh’s house, of bright bronze.  [17] The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.  [18] Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance, so that the weight of the bronze could not be determined.\n     [19] Solomon made all the vessels that were in God’s house: the golden altar, the tables with the show bread on them,  [20] and the lamp stands with their lamps to burn according to the ordinance before the inner sanctuary, of pure gold;  [21] and the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs of gold that was purest gold;  [22] and the snuffers, the basins, the spoons, and the fire pans of pure gold. As for the entry of the house, its inner doors for the most holy place and the doors of the main hall of the temple were of gold.\n"

[4] He built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the storage cities, which he built in Hamath.  [5] Also he built Beth Horon the upper and Beth Horon the lower, fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars;  [6] and Baalath, and all the storage cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots, the cities for his horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.\n     [7] As for all the people who were left of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel—  [8] of their children who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel didn’t consume—of them Solomon conscripted forced labor to this day.  [9] But of the children of Israel, Solomon made no servants for his work, but they were men of war, chief of his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.  [10] These were the chief officers of King Solomon, even two-hundred fifty, who ruled over the people.\n     [11] Solomon brought up Pharaoh’s daughter out of David’s city to the house that He had built for her; for He said, “My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places where Yahweh’s ark has come are holy.”\n     [12] Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to Yahweh on Yahweh’s altar which He had built before the porch,  [13] even as the duty of every day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, three times per year, during the feast of unleavened bread, during the feast of weeks, and during the feast of booths.\n     [14] He appointed, according to the ordinance of David His father, the divisions of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their offices, to praise and to minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required, the doorkeepers also by their divisions at every gate, for David the man of God had so commanded.

When she had come to Solomon, she talked with him about all that was in her heart.  [2] Solomon answered all her questions. There wasn’t anything hidden from Solomon which he didn’t tell her.  [3] When the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built,  [4] the food of His table, the seating of His servants, the attendance of His ministers, their clothing, His cup bearers and their clothing, and His ascent by which He went up to Yahweh’s house, there was no more spirit in her.\n     [5] She said to the king, “It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts and of your wisdom.  [6] However I didn’t believe their words until I came, and my eyes had seen it; and behold half of the greatness of your wisdom wasn’t told me. You exceed the fame that I heard!

[8] Blessed be Yahweh your God, who delighted in you and set you on His throne to be king for Yahweh your God, because your God loved Israel, to establish them forever. Therefore He made you king over them, to do justice and righteousness.”\n     [9] She gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, spices in great abundance, and precious stones. There was never before such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.\n     [10] The servants of Huram and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, also brought algum trees and precious stones.  [11] The king used algum tree wood to make terraces for Yahweh’s house and for the king’s house, and harps and stringed instruments for the singers. There were none like these seen before in the land of Judah.  [12] King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, more than that which she had brought to the king. So she turned and went to her own land, she and her servants.\n     [13] Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred sixty-six talents of gold,  [14] in addition to that which the traders and merchants brought. All the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.  [15] King Solomon made two hundred large shields of beaten gold. Six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one large shield.  [16] He made three hundred shields of beaten gold. Three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield. The king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.  [17] Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.  [18] There were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and armrests on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the armrests.  [19] Twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps. There was nothing like it made in any other kingdom.  [20] All King Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. Silver was not considered valuable in the days of Solomon.  [21] For the king had ships that went to Tarshish with Huram’s servants. Once every three years, the ships of Tarshish came bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.\n     [22] So King Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.  [23] All the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear His wisdom, which God had put in His heart.  [24] They each brought tribute: vessels of silver, vessels of gold, clothing, armor, spices, horses, and mules every year.  [25] Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen that he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem.  [26] He ruled over all the kings from the River even to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.  [27] The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars to be as abundant as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland.  [28] They brought horses for Solomon out of Egypt and out of all lands.\n     [29] Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, aren’t they written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?  [30] Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.  [31] Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in his father David’s city; and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.\n"

My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.”\n     [15] So the king didn’t listen to the people; for it was brought about by God, that Yahweh might establish His word, which He spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.\n     [16] When all Israel saw that the king didn’t listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, “What portion do we have in David? We don’t have an inheritance in the son of Jesse! Every man to your tents, Israel! Now see to your own house, David.” So all Israel departed to their tents.\n     [17] But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.  [18] Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the men subject to forced labor; and the children of Israel stoned him to death with stones. King Rehoboam hurried to get himself up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.  [19] So Israel rebelled against David’s house to this day.\n"

Every man return to His house; for this thing is of me.”’” So they listened to Yahweh’s words, and returned from going against Jeroboam.\n     [5] Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah.

Judah and Benjamin belonged to him.\n     [13] The priests and the Levites who were in all Israel stood with him out of all their territory.  [14] For the Levites left their pasture lands and their possessions, and came to Judah and Jerusalem; for Jeroboam and His sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priest’s office to Yahweh.  [15] He himself appointed priests for the high places, for the male goat and calf idols which he had made.

[22] Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief, the prince among his brothers, for he intended to make him king.  [23] He dealt wisely, and dispersed some of his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city. He gave them food in abundance; and he sought many wives for them.\n"

[2] In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had trespassed against Yahweh,  [3] with twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen. The people were without number who came with him out of Egypt: the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians.  [4] He took the fortified cities which belonged to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.  [5] Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and to the princes of Judah, who were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, “Yahweh says, ‘You have forsaken me, therefore I have also left you in the hand of Shishak.’”\n     [6] Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, “Yahweh is righteous.”\n     [7] When Yahweh saw that they humbled themselves, Yahweh’s word came to Shemaiah, saying, “They have humbled themselves. I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath won’t be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.  [8] Nevertheless they will be his servants, that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.”\n     [9] So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem and took away the treasures of Yahweh’s house and the treasures of the king’s house. He took it all away. He also took away the shields of gold which Solomon had made.  [10] King Rehoboam made shields of bronze in their place, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who kept the door of the king’s house.  [11] As often as the king entered into Yahweh’s house, the guard came and bore them, then brought them back into the guard room.  [12] When He humbled Himself, Yahweh’s wrath turned from Him, so as not to destroy Him altogether. Moreover, there were good things found in Judah.\n     [13] So King Rehoboam strengthened Himself in Jerusalem and reigned; for Rehoboam was forty-one years old when He began to reign, and He reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Yahweh had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put His name there. His mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess.  [14] He did that which was evil, because He didn’t set His heart to seek Yahweh.\n     [15] Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, aren’t they written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, in the genealogies? There were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.  [16] Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in David’s city; and Abijah his son reigned in his place.\n"

His mother’s name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.  [3] Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men; and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valor.  [4] Abijah stood up on Mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, “Hear me, Jeroboam and all Israel:  [5] Ought you not to know that Yahweh, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever, even to Him and to His sons by a covenant of salt?  [6] Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord.  [7] Worthless men were gathered to him, wicked fellows who strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender hearted, and could not withstand them.\n     [8] “Now you intend to withstand the kingdom of Yahweh in the hand of the sons of David. You are a great multitude, and the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods are with you.  [9] Haven’t you driven out the priests of Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made priests for yourselves according to the ways of the peoples of other lands? Whoever comes to consecrate Himself with a young bull and seven rams may be a priest of those who are no gods.\n     [10] “But as for us, Yahweh is our God, and we have not forsaken Him. We have priests serving Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work.  [11] They burn to Yahweh every morning and every evening burnt offerings and sweet incense. They also set the show bread in order on the pure table, and care for the gold lamp stand with its lamps, to burn every evening; for we keep the instruction of Yahweh our God, but you have forsaken Him.  [12] Behold, God is with us at our head, and His priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. Children of Israel, don’t fight against Yahweh, the God of your fathers; for you will not prosper.”\n     [13] But Jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them; so they were before Judah, and the ambush was behind them.  [14] When Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried to Yahweh, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.  [15] Then the men of Judah gave a shout. As the men of Judah shouted, God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.  [16] The children of Israel fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hand.  [17] Abijah and his people killed them with a great slaughter, so five hundred thousand chosen men of Israel fell down slain.  [18] Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied on Yahweh, the God of their fathers.  [19] Abijah pursued Jeroboam, and took cities from him: Bethel with its villages, Jeshanah with its villages, and Ephron with its villages.\n     [20] Jeroboam didn’t recover strength again in the days of Abijah. Yahweh struck Him, and He died.  [21] But Abijah grew mighty and took for himself fourteen wives, and became the father of twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.  [22] The rest of the acts of Abijah, his ways, and his sayings are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo.\n"

[2] Asa did that which was good and right in Yahweh His God’s eyes,  [3] for he took away the foreign altars and the high places, broke down the pillars, cut down the Asherah poles,  [4] and commanded Judah to seek Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and to obey His law and command.  [5] Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun images; and the kingdom was quiet before him.  [6] He built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and He had no war in those years, because Yahweh had given Him rest.  [7] For He said to Judah, “Let’s build these cities and make walls around them, with towers, gates, and bars. The land is yet before us, because we have sought Yahweh our God. We have sought Him, and He has given us rest on every side.” So they built and prospered.\n     [8] Asa had an army of three hundred thousand out of Judah who bore bucklers and spears, and two hundred eighty thousand out of Benjamin who bore shields and drew bows. All these were mighty men of valor.\n     [9] Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million troops and three hundred chariots, and he came to Mareshah.  [10] Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.  [11] Asa cried to Yahweh His God, and said, “Yahweh, there is no one besides you to help, between the mighty and Him who has no strength. Help us, Yahweh our God; for we rely on you, and in your name are we come against this multitude. Yahweh, you are our God. Don’t let man prevail against you.”\n     [12] So Yahweh struck the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.  [13] Asa and the people who were with Him pursued them to Gerar. So many of the Ethiopians fell that they could not recover themselves, for they were destroyed before Yahweh and before His army. Judah’s army carried away very much booty.  [14] They struck all the cities around Gerar, for the fear of Yahweh came on them. They plundered all the cities, for there was much plunder in them.  [15] They also struck the tents of those who had livestock, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, then returned to Jerusalem.\n"

[3] Now for a long time Israel was without the true God, without a teaching priest, and without law.

Don’t let your hands be slack, for your work will be rewarded.”\n     [8] When Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, He took courage, and put away the abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which He had taken from the hill country of Ephraim; and He renewed Yahweh’s altar that was before Yahweh’s porch.  [9] He gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those who lived with them out of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon; for they came to Him out of Israel in abundance when they saw that Yahweh His God was with Him.  [10] So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of Asa’s reign.  [11] They sacrificed to Yahweh in that day, of the plunder which they had brought, seven hundred head of cattle and seven thousand sheep.  [12] They entered into the covenant to seek Yahweh, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul;  [13] and that whoever would not seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.  [14] They swore to Yahweh with a loud voice, with shouting, with trumpets, and with cornets.  [15] All Judah rejoiced at the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart and sought Him with their whole desire; and He was found by them. Then Yahweh gave them rest all around.\n     [16] Also Maacah, the mother of Asa the king, he removed from being queen mother, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; so Asa cut down her image, ground it into dust, and burned it at the brook Kidron.  [17] But the high places were not taken away out of Israel; nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.  [18] He brought the things that His father had dedicated and that He Himself had dedicated, silver, gold, and vessels into God’s house.

You have done foolishly in this; for from now on you will have wars.”\n     [10] Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in the prison; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time.\n     [11] Behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.

Ahab killed sheep and cattle for him in abundance, and for the people who were with him, and moved him to go up with him to Ramoth Gilead.  [3] Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, “Will you go with me to Ramoth Gilead?”\n    He answered him, “I am as you are, and my people as your people. We will be with you in the war.”  [4] Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “Please inquire first for Yahweh’s word.”\n     [5] Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them, “Shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?”\n    They said, “Go up, for God will deliver it into the hand of the king.”\n     [6] But Jehoshaphat said, “Isn’t there here a prophet of Yahweh besides, that we may inquire of Him?”\n     [7] The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Yahweh; but I hate Him, for He never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil. He is Micaiah the son of Imla.”\n    Jehoshaphat said, “Don’t let the king say so.”\n     [8] Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, “Get Micaiah the son of Imla quickly.”\n     [9] Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah each sat on his throne, arrayed in their robes, and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.  [10] Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made Himself horns of iron and said, “Yahweh says, ‘With these you shall push the Syrians, until they are consumed.’”\n     [11] All the prophets prophesied so, saying, “Go up to Ramoth Gilead, and prosper; for Yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the king.”\n     [12] The messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, “Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth. Let your word therefore, please be like one of theirs, and speak good.”\n     [13] Micaiah said, “As Yahweh lives, I will say what my God says.”\n     [14] When he had come to the king, the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?”\n    He said, “Go up, and prosper. They shall be delivered into your hand.”\n     [15] The king said to Him, “How many times shall I adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in Yahweh’s name?”\n     [16] He said, “I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. Yahweh said, ‘These have no master. Let them each return to His house in peace.’”\n     [17] The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?”\n     [18] Micaiah said, “Therefore hear Yahweh’s word: I saw Yahweh sitting on His throne, and all the army of heaven standing on His right hand and on His left.  [19] Yahweh said, ‘Who will entice Ahab king of Israel, that He may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead?’ One spoke saying in this way, and another saying in that way.  [20] A spirit came out, stood before Yahweh, and said, ‘I will entice Him.’\n    “Yahweh said to Him, ‘How?’\n     [21] “He said, ‘I will go, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’\n    “He said, ‘You will entice him, and will prevail also. Go and do so.’\n     [22] “Now therefore, behold, Yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets; and Yahweh has spoken evil concerning you.”\n     [23] Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, “Which way did Yahweh’s Spirit go from me to speak to you?”\n     [24] Micaiah said, “Behold, you shall see on that day, when you go into an inner room to hide yourself.”\n     [25] The king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son;  [26] and say, ‘The king says, “Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.”’”\n     [27] Micaiah said, “If you return at all in peace, Yahweh has not spoken by me.” He said, “Listen, you people, all of you!”\n     [28] So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.  [29] The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but you put on your robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went into the battle.  [30] Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying, “Don’t fight with small nor great, except only with the king of Israel.”\n     [31] When the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “It is the king of Israel!” Therefore they turned around to fight against Him. But Jehoshaphat cried out, and Yahweh helped Him; and God moved them to depart from Him.  [32] When the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.  [33] A certain man drew his bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armor. Therefore he said to the driver of the chariot, “Turn around and carry me out of the battle, for I am severely wounded.”  [34] The battle increased that day. However, the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the evening; and at about sunset, he died.\n"

Go out against them tomorrow, for Yahweh is with you.’”\n     [18] Jehoshaphat bowed His head with His face to the ground; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before Yahweh, worshiping Yahweh.  [19] The Levites, of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites, stood up to praise Yahweh, the God of Israel, with an exceedingly loud voice.\n     [20] They rose early in the morning and went out into the wilderness of Tekoa. As they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Listen to me, Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem! Believe in Yahweh your God, so you will be established! Believe His prophets, so you will prosper.”\n     [21] When He had taken counsel with the people, He appointed those who were to sing to Yahweh and give praise in holy array as they go out before the army, and say, “Give thanks to Yahweh, for His loving kindness endures forever.”  [22] When they began to sing and to praise, Yahweh set ambushers against the children of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; and they were struck.  [23] For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir to utterly kill and destroy them. When they had finished the inhabitants of Seir, everyone helped to destroy each other.\n     [24] When Judah came to the place overlooking the wilderness, they looked at the multitude; and behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and there were none who escaped.  [25] When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take their plunder, they found among them in abundance both riches and dead bodies with precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away. They took plunder for three days, it was so much.  [26] On the fourth day, they assembled themselves in Beracah Valley, for there they blessed Yahweh. Therefore the name of that place was called “Beracah Valley” to this day.  [27] Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat in front of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for Yahweh had made them to rejoice over their enemies.  [28] They came to Jerusalem with stringed instruments, harps, and trumpets to Yahweh’s house.  [29] The fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the countries when they heard that Yahweh fought against the enemies of Israel.  [30] So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet, for His God gave Him rest all around.\n     [31] So Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he began to reign. He reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.  [32] He walked in the way of Asa His father, and didn’t turn away from it, doing that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes.  [33] However the high places were not taken away, and the people had still not set their hearts on the God of their fathers.\n     [34] Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is included in the book of the kings of Israel.\n     [35] After this, Jehoshaphat king of Judah joined himself with Ahaziah king of Israel. The same did very wickedly.  [36] He joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish. They made the ships in Ezion Geber.  [37] Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, “Because you have joined yourself with Ahaziah, Yahweh has destroyed your works.” The ships were wrecked, so that they were not able to go to Tarshish.\n"

[2] He had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah. All these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.  [3] Their father gave them great gifts of silver, of gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities in Judah; but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram, because he was the firstborn.  [4] Now when Jehoram had risen up over the kingdom of his father, and had strengthened himself, he killed all his brothers with the sword, and also some of the princes of Israel.  [5] Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.  [6] He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did Ahab’s house, for He had Ahab’s daughter as His wife. He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight.  [7] However Yahweh would not destroy David’s house, because of the covenant that He had made with David, and as He promised to give a lamp to Him and to His children always.\n     [8] In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.  [9] Then Jehoram went there with his captains and all his chariots with him. He rose up by night and struck the Edomites who surrounded him, along with the captains of the chariots.  [10] So Edom has been in revolt from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time from under His hand, because He had forsaken Yahweh, the God of His fathers.\n     [11] Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and made the inhabitants of Jerusalem play the prostitute, and led Judah astray.  [12] A letter came to Him from Elijah the prophet, saying, “Yahweh, the God of David your father, says, ‘Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,  [13] but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the prostitute like Ahab’s house did, and also have slain your brothers of your father’s house, who were better than yourself,  [14] behold, Yahweh will strike your people with a great plague, including your children, your wives, and all your possessions;  [15] and you will have great sickness with a disease of your bowels, until your bowels fall out by reason of the sickness, day by day.’”\n     [16] Yahweh stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and of the Arabians who are beside the Ethiopians;  [17] and they came up against Judah, broke into it, and carried away all the possessions that were found in the king’s house, including his sons and his wives, so that there was no son left to him except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.\n     [18] After all this Yahweh struck Him in His bowels with an incurable disease.  [19] In process of time, at the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness, and he died of severe diseases. His people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.  [20] He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. He departed with no one’s regret. They buried him in David’s city, but not in the tombs of the kings.\n"

So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.  [2] Ahaziah was forty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.  [3] He also walked in the ways of Ahab’s house, because his mother was his counselor in acting wickedly.  [4] He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, as did Ahab’s house, for they were His counselors after the death of His father, to His destruction.  [5] He also followed their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.  [6] He returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. Azariah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.\n     [7] Now the destruction of Ahaziah was of God, in that He went to Joram; for when He had come, He went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom Yahweh had anointed to cut off Ahab’s house.  [8] When Jehu was executing judgment on Ahab’s house, he found the princes of Judah and the sons of the brothers of Ahaziah serving Ahaziah, and killed them.  [9] He sought Ahaziah, and they caught Him (now He was hiding in Samaria), and they brought Him to Jehu and killed Him; and they buried Him, for they said, “He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought Yahweh with all His heart.” The house of Ahaziah had no power to hold the kingdom.\n     [10] Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal offspring of the house of Judah.  [11] But Jehoshabeath, the king’s daughter, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stealthily rescued him from among the king’s sons who were slain, and put him and his nurse in the bedroom. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah, so that she didn’t kill him.  [12] He was with them hidden in God’s house six years while Athaliah reigned over the land.\n"

[2] They went around in Judah and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the heads of fathers’ households of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.  [3] All the assembly made a covenant with the king in God’s house. Jehoiada said to them, “Behold, the king’s son must reign, as Yahweh has spoken concerning the sons of David.  [4] This is the thing that you must do: a third part of you, who come in on the Sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be gatekeepers of the thresholds.  [5] A third part shall be at the king’s house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation. All the people will be in the courts of Yahweh’s house.  [6] But let no one come into Yahweh’s house except the priests and those who minister of the Levites. They shall come in, for they are holy, but all the people shall follow Yahweh’s instructions.  [7] The Levites shall surround the king, every man with his weapons in his hand. Whoever comes into the house, let him be slain. Be with the king when he comes in and when he goes out.”\n     [8] So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. They each took his men, those who were to come in on the Sabbath, with those who were to go out on the Sabbath, for Jehoiada the priest didn’t dismiss the shift.  [9] Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears, bucklers, and shields that had been king David’s, which were in God’s house.  [10] He set all the people, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, near the altar and the house, around the king.  [11] Then they brought out the king’s son, put the crown on him, gave him the covenant, and made him king. Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and they said, “Long live the king!”\n     [12] When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into Yahweh’s house.  [13] Then she looked, and behold, the king stood by his pillar at the entrance, with the captains and the trumpeters by the king. All the people of the land rejoiced and blew trumpets. The singers also played musical instruments, and led the singing of praise. Then Athaliah tore her clothes, and said, “Treason! treason!”\n     [14] Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to them, “Bring her out between the ranks; and whoever follows her, let Him be slain with the sword.” For the priest said, “Don’t kill her in Yahweh’s house.”  [15] So they made way for her. She went to the entrance of the horse gate to the king’s house; and they killed her there.\n     [16] Jehoiada made a covenant between Himself, all the people, and the king, that they should be Yahweh’s people.  [17] All the people went to the house of Baal, broke it down, broke his altars and his images in pieces, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.  [18] Jehoiada appointed the officers of Yahweh’s house under the hand of the Levitical priests, whom David had distributed in Yahweh’s house, to offer the burnt offerings of Yahweh, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as David had ordered.  [19] He set the gatekeepers at the gates of Yahweh’s house, that no one who was unclean in anything should enter in.  [20] He took the captains of hundreds, the nobles, the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought the king down from Yahweh’s house. They came through the upper gate to the king’s house, and set the king on the throne of the kingdom.  [21] So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet.

[2] Joash did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes all the days of Jehoiada the priest.  [3] Jehoiada took for him two wives, and he became the father of sons and daughters.\n     [4] After this, Joash intended to restore Yahweh’s house.  [5] He gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, “Go out to the cities of Judah, and gather money to repair the house of your God from all Israel from year to year. See that you expedite this matter.” However the Levites didn’t do it right away.  [6] The king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said to Him, “Why haven’t you required of the Levites to bring in the tax of Moses the servant of Yahweh, and of the assembly of Israel, out of Judah and out of Jerusalem, for the Tent of the Testimony?”  [7] For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up God’s house; and they also gave all the dedicated things of Yahweh’s house to the Baals.\n     [8] So the king commanded, and they made a chest, and set it outside at the gate of Yahweh’s house.  [9] They made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in for Yahweh the tax that Moses the servant of God laid on Israel in the wilderness.  [10] All the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had filled it.  [11] Whenever the chest was brought to the king’s officers by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king’s scribe and the chief priest’s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.  [12] The king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the service of Yahweh’s house. They hired masons and carpenters to restore Yahweh’s house, and also those who worked iron and bronze to repair Yahweh’s house.  [13] So the workmen worked, and the work of repairing went forward in their hands. They set up God’s house as it was designed, and strengthened it.  [14] When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, from which were made vessels for Yahweh’s house, even vessels with which to minister and to offer, including spoons and vessels of gold and silver. They offered burnt offerings in Yahweh’s house continually all the days of Jehoiada.\n     [15] But Jehoiada grew old and was full of days, and he died. He was one hundred thirty years old when he died.  [16] They buried Him in David’s city among the kings, because He had done good in Israel, and toward God and His house.\n     [17] Now after the death of Jehoiada, the princes of Judah came and bowed down to the king. Then the king listened to them.  [18] They abandoned the house of Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherah poles and the idols, so wrath came on Judah and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness.  [19] Yet He sent prophets to them to bring them again to Yahweh, and they testified against them; but they would not listen.\n     [20] The Spirit of God came on Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and He stood above the people, and said to them, “God says, ‘Why do you disobey Yahweh’s commandments, so that you can’t prosper? Because you have forsaken Yahweh, He has also forsaken you.’”\n     [21] They conspired against Him, and stoned Him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of Yahweh’s house.  [22] Thus Joash the king didn’t remember the kindness which Jehoiada His father had done to Him, but killed His son. When He died, He said, “May Yahweh look at it, and repay it.”\n     [23] At the end of the year, the army of the Syrians came up against him. They came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all their plunder to the king of Damascus.  [24] For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men; and Yahweh delivered a very great army into their hand, because they had forsaken Yahweh, the God of their fathers. So they executed judgment on Joash.\n     [25] When they had departed from him (for they left him seriously wounded), his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and killed him on his bed, and he died. They buried him in David’s city, but they didn’t bury him in the tombs of the kings.  [26] These are those who conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess.  [27] Now concerning His sons, the greatness of the burdens laid on Him, and the rebuilding of God’s house, behold, they are written in the commentary of the book of the kings.

[2] He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, but not with a perfect heart.  [3] Now when the kingdom was established to him, he killed his servants who had killed his father the king.  [4] But He didn’t put their children to death, but did according to that which is written in the law in the book of Moses, as Yahweh commanded, saying, “The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers; but every man shall die for His own sin.”\n     [5] Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together and ordered them according to their fathers’ houses, under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, even all Judah and Benjamin. He counted them from twenty years old and upward, and found that there were three hundred thousand chosen men, able to go out to war, who could handle spear and shield.  [6] He also hired one hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for one hundred talents of silver.  [7] A man of God came to Him, saying, “O king, don’t let the army of Israel go with you, for Yahweh is not with Israel, with all the children of Ephraim.  [8] But if you will go, take action, and be strong for the battle. God will overthrow you before the enemy; for God has power to help, and to overthrow.”\n     [9] Amaziah said to the man of God, “But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel?”\n    The man of God answered, “Yahweh is able to give you much more than this.”\n     [10] Then Amaziah separated them, the army that had come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again. Therefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in fierce anger.\n     [11] Amaziah took courage, and led his people out and went to the Valley of Salt, and struck ten thousand of the children of Seir.  [12] The children of Judah carried away ten thousand alive, and brought them to the top of the rock, and threw them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were broken in pieces.  [13] But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell on the cities of Judah from Samaria even to Beth Horon, and struck of them three thousand, and took much plunder.\n     [14] Now after Amaziah had come from the slaughter of the Edomites, he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them and burned incense to them.  [15] Therefore Yahweh’s anger burned against Amaziah, and He sent to Him a prophet who said to Him, “Why have you sought after the gods of the people, which have not delivered their own people out of your hand?”\n     [16] As He talked with Him, the king said to Him, “Have we made you one of the king’s counselors? Stop! Why should you be struck down?”\n    Then the prophet stopped, and said, “I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel.”\n     [17] Then Amaziah king of Judah consulted his advisers, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come! Let’s look one another in the face.”\n     [18] Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, “The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son as his wife. Then a wild animal that was in Lebanon passed by and trampled down the thistle.  [19] You say to yourself that you have struck Edom; and your heart lifts you up to boast. Now stay at home. Why should you meddle with trouble, that you should fall, even you and Judah with you?’”\n     [20] But Amaziah would not listen; for it was of God, that He might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they had sought after the gods of Edom.  [21] So Joash king of Israel went up, and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah.  [22] Judah was defeated by Israel; so every man fled to his tent.\n     [23] Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth Shemesh and brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.  [24] He took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in God’s house with Obed-Edom, and the treasures of the king’s house, and the hostages, and returned to Samaria.\n     [25] Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived for fifteen years after the death of Joash, son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel.  [26] Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, aren’t they written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?

His name spread abroad even to the entrance of Egypt, for he grew exceedingly strong.  [9] Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.  [10] He built towers in the wilderness, and dug out many cisterns, for he had much livestock, both in the lowlands and in the plains. He had farmers and vineyard keepers in the mountains and in the fruitful fields, for he loved farming.

[12] The whole number of the heads of fathers’ households, even the mighty men of valor, was two thousand six hundred.  [13] Under their hand was an army, three hundred seven thousand five hundred, who made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.  [14] Uzziah prepared for them, even for all the army, shields, spears, helmets, coats of mail, bows, and stones for slinging.  [15] In Jerusalem, he made devices, invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and on the battlements, with which to shoot arrows and great stones. His name spread far abroad, because he was marvelously helped until he was strong.\n     [16] But when He was strong, His heart was lifted up, so that He did corruptly and He trespassed against Yahweh His God, for He went into Yahweh’s temple to burn incense on the altar of incense.  [17] Azariah the priest went in after Him, and with Him eighty priests of Yahweh, who were valiant men.  [18] They resisted Uzziah the king, and said to Him, “It isn’t for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to Yahweh, but for the priests the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense. Go out of the sanctuary, for you have trespassed. It will not be for your honor from Yahweh God.”\n     [19] Then Uzziah was angry. He had a censer in His hand to burn incense, and while He was angry with the priests, the leprosy broke out on His forehead before the priests in Yahweh’s house, beside the altar of incense.  [20] Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked at Him, and behold, He was leprous in His forehead; and they thrust Him out quickly from there. Indeed, He Himself also hurried to go out, because Yahweh had struck Him.  [21] Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of His death, and lived in a separate house, being a leper; for He was cut off from Yahweh’s house. Jotham His son was over the king’s house, judging the people of the land.\n     [22] Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, wrote.  [23] So Uzziah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings, for they said, “He is a leper.” Jotham his son reigned in his place.\n"

[7] Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars and his ways, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.  [8] He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.  [9] Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in David’s city; and Ahaz his son reigned in his place.\n"

          "content": "     [1] Ahaz was twenty years old when He began to reign, and He reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. He didn’t do that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, like David His father,  [2] but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and also made molten images for the Baals.  [3] Moreover He burned incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burned His children in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel.  [4] He sacrificed and burned incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.\n     [5] Therefore Yahweh His God delivered Him into the hand of the king of Syria. They struck Him, and carried away from Him a great multitude of captives, and brought them to Damascus. He was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who struck Him with a great slaughter.  [6] For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed in Judah one hundred twenty thousand in one day, all of them valiant men, because they had forsaken Yahweh, the God of their fathers.  [7] Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king’s son, Azrikam the ruler of the house, and Elkanah who was next to the king.  [8] The children of Israel carried away captive of their brothers two hundred thousand women, sons, and daughters, and also took away much plunder from them, and brought the plunder to Samaria.  [9] But a prophet of Yahweh was there, whose name was Oded; and He went out to meet the army that came to Samaria, and said to them, “Behold, because Yahweh, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, He has delivered them into your hand, and you have slain them in a rage which has reached up to heaven.  [10] Now you intend to degrade the children of Judah and Jerusalem as male and female slaves for yourselves. Aren’t there even with you trespasses of your own against Yahweh your God?  [11] Now hear me therefore, and send back the captives that you have taken captive from your brothers, for the fierce wrath of Yahweh is on you.”  [12] Then some of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who came from the war,  [13] and said to them, “You must not bring in the captives here, for you intend that which will bring on us a trespass against Yahweh, to add to our sins and to our guilt; for our guilt is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.”\n     [14] So the armed men left the captives and the plunder before the princes and all the assembly.  [15] The men who have been mentioned by name rose up and took the captives, and with the plunder clothed all who were naked among them, dressed them, gave them sandals, gave them something to eat and to drink, anointed them, carried all the feeble of them on donkeys, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brothers. Then they returned to Samaria.\n     [16] At that time King Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria to help him.  [17] For again the Edomites had come and struck Judah, and carried away captives.  [18] The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth Shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and also Gimzo and its villages; and they lived there.  [19] For Yahweh brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel, because He acted without restraint in Judah and trespassed severely against Yahweh.  [20] Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came to him and gave him trouble, but didn’t strengthen him.  [21] For Ahaz took away a portion out of Yahweh’s house, and out of the house of the king and of the princes, and gave it to the king of Assyria; but it didn’t help Him.\n     [22] In the time of His distress, He trespassed yet more against Yahweh, this same King Ahaz.  [23] For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus which had defeated him. He said, “Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, I will sacrifice to them, that they may help me.” But they were the ruin of him and of all Israel.  [24] Ahaz gathered together the vessels of God’s house, cut the vessels of God’s house in pieces, and shut up the doors of Yahweh’s house; and He made Himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem.  [25] In every city of Judah He made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked Yahweh, the God of His fathers, to anger.\n     [26] Now the rest of his acts, and all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.  [27] Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem, because they didn’t bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel; and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.\n"

[2] He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, according to all that David His father had done.  [3] In the first year of His reign, in the first month, He opened the doors of Yahweh’s house and repaired them.  [4] He brought in the priests and the Levites and gathered them together into the wide place on the east,  [5] and said to them, “Listen to me, you Levites! Now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of Yahweh, the God of your fathers, and carry the filthiness out of the holy place.  [6] For our fathers were unfaithful, and have done that which was evil in Yahweh our God’s sight, and have forsaken Him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of Yahweh, and turned their backs.  [7] Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel.  [8] Therefore Yahweh’s wrath was on Judah and Jerusalem, and He has delivered them to be tossed back and forth, to be an astonishment and a hissing, as you see with your eyes.  [9] For behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.  [10] Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with Yahweh, the God of Israel, that His fierce anger may turn away from us.  [11] My sons, don’t be negligent now; for Yahweh has chosen you to stand before Him, to minister to Him, and that you should be His ministers and burn incense.”\n     [12] Then the Levites arose: Mahath, the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah;  [13] and of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;  [14] and of the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.  [15] They gathered their brothers, sanctified themselves, and went in, according to the commandment of the king by Yahweh’s words, to cleanse Yahweh’s house.  [16] The priests went into the inner part of Yahweh’s house to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in Yahweh’s temple into the court of Yahweh’s house. The Levites took it from there to carry it out to the brook Kidron.  [17] Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month they came to Yahweh’s porch. They sanctified Yahweh’s house in eight days, and on the sixteenth day of the first month they finished.  [18] Then they went in to Hezekiah the king within the palace and said, “We have cleansed all Yahweh’s house, including the altar of burnt offering with all its vessels, and the table of show bread with all its vessels.  [19] Moreover, we have prepared and sanctified all the vessels which King Ahaz threw away in His reign when He was unfaithful. Behold, they are before Yahweh’s altar.”\n     [20] Then Hezekiah the king arose early, gathered the princes of the city, and went up to Yahweh’s house.  [21] They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah. He commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on Yahweh’s altar.  [22] So they killed the bulls, and the priests received the blood and sprinkled it on the altar. They killed the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar. They also killed the lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar.  [23] They brought near the male goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly; and they laid their hands on them.  [24] Then the priests killed them, and they made a sin offering with their blood on the altar, to make atonement for all Israel; for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel.\n     [25] He set the Levites in Yahweh’s house with cymbals, with stringed instruments, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, of Gad the king’s seer, and Nathan the prophet; for the commandment was from Yahweh by His prophets.  [26] The Levites stood with David’s instruments, and the priests with the trumpets.  [27] Hezekiah commanded them to offer the burnt offering on the altar. When the burnt offering began, Yahweh’s song also began, along with the trumpets and instruments of David king of Israel.  [28] All the assembly worshiped, the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded. All this continued until the burnt offering was finished.\n     [29] When they had finished offering, the king and all who were present with him bowed themselves and worshiped.  [30] Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises to Yahweh with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. They sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshiped.\n     [31] Then Hezekiah answered, “Now you have consecrated yourselves to Yahweh. Come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into Yahweh’s house.” The assembly brought in sacrifices and thank offerings, and as many as were of a willing heart brought burnt offerings.  [32] The number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs. All these were for a burnt offering to Yahweh.  [33] The consecrated things were six hundred head of cattle and three thousand sheep.  [34] But the priests were too few, so that they could not skin all the burnt offerings. Therefore their brothers the Levites helped them until the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves, for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.  [35] Also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings and with the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of Yahweh’s house was set in order.  [36] Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced because of that which God had prepared for the people; for the thing was done suddenly.\n"

          "content": "     [1] Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to Yahweh’s house at Jerusalem, to keep the Passover to Yahweh, the God of Israel.  [2] For the king had taken counsel with his princes and all the assembly in Jerusalem to keep the Passover in the second month.  [3] For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, and the people had not gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.  [4] The thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly.  [5] So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the Passover to Yahweh, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem, for they had not kept it in great numbers in the way it is written.\n     [6] So the couriers went with the letters from the king and His princes throughout all Israel and Judah, according to the commandment of the king, saying, “You children of Israel, turn again to Yahweh, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that He may return to the remnant of you that have escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.  [7] Don’t be like your fathers and like your brothers, who trespassed against Yahweh, the God of their fathers, so that He gave them up to desolation, as you see.  [8] Now don’t be stiff-necked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves to Yahweh, and enter into His sanctuary, which He has sanctified forever, and serve Yahweh your God, that His fierce anger may turn away from you.  [9] For if you turn again to Yahweh, your brothers and your children will find compassion with those who led them captive, and will come again into this land, because Yahweh your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away His face from you if you return to Him.”\n     [10] So the couriers passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even to Zebulun, but people ridiculed them and mocked them.  [11] Nevertheless some men of Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.  [12] Also the hand of God came on Judah to give them one heart, to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by Yahweh’s word.\n     [13] Many people assembled at Jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great assembly.  [14] They arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and they took away all the altars for incense and threw them into the brook Kidron.  [15] Then they killed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt offerings into Yahweh’s house.  [16] They stood in their place after their order, according to the law of Moses the man of God. The priests sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the Levites.  [17] For there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves; therefore the Levites were in charge of killing the Passovers for everyone who was not clean, to sanctify them to Yahweh.  [18] For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover other than the way it is written. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, “May the good Yahweh pardon everyone  [19] who sets His heart to seek God, Yahweh, the God of His fathers, even if they aren’t clean according to the purification of the sanctuary.”\n     [20] Yahweh listened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.  [21] The children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness. The Levites and the priests praised Yahweh day by day, singing with loud instruments to Yahweh.  [22] Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who had good understanding in the service of Yahweh. So they ate throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace offerings and making confession to Yahweh, the God of their fathers.\n     [23] The whole assembly took counsel to keep another seven days, and they kept another seven days with gladness.  [24] For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the assembly for offerings one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep; and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.  [25] All the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly who came out of Israel, and the foreigners who came out of the land of Israel and who lived in Judah, rejoiced.  [26] So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was nothing like this in Jerusalem.  [27] Then the Levitical priests arose and blessed the people. Their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, even to heaven.\n"

Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.\n     [2] Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites after their divisions, every man according to His service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of Yahweh’s camp.  [3] He also appointed the king’s portion of His possessions for the burnt offerings: for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths, for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in Yahweh’s law.  [4] Moreover He commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to Yahweh’s law.  [5] As soon as the commandment went out, the children of Israel gave in abundance the first fruits of grain, new wine, oil, honey, and of all the increase of the field; and they brought in the tithe of all things abundantly.  [6] The children of Israel and Judah, who lived in the cities of Judah, also brought in the tithe of cattle and sheep, and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated to Yahweh their God, and laid them in heaps.\n     [7] In the third month, they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.  [8] When Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed Yahweh and His people Israel.  [9] Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites about the heaps.  [10] Azariah the chief priest, of the house of Zadok, answered Him and said, “Since people began to bring the offerings into Yahweh’s house, we have eaten and had enough, and have plenty left over, for Yahweh has blessed His people; and that which is left is this great store.”\n     [11] Then Hezekiah commanded them to prepare rooms in Yahweh’s house, and they prepared them.  [12] They brought in the offerings, the tithes, and the dedicated things faithfully. Conaniah the Levite was ruler over them, and Shimei his brother was second.  [13] Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei His brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king and Azariah the ruler of God’s house.  [14] Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the gatekeeper at the east gate, was over the free will offerings of God, to distribute Yahweh’s offerings and the most holy things.  [15] Under him were Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their office of trust, to give to their brothers by divisions, to the great as well as to the small;  [16] in addition to those who were listed by genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even everyone who entered into Yahweh’s house, as the duty of every day required, for their service in their offices according to their divisions;  [17] and those who were listed by genealogy of the priests by their fathers’ houses, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their offices by their divisions;  [18] and those who were listed by genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation; for in their office of trust they sanctified themselves in holiness.  [19] Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, who were in the fields of the pasture lands of their cities, in every city, there were men who were mentioned by name to give portions to all the males among the priests and to all who were listed by genealogy among the Levites.\n     [20] Hezekiah did so throughout all Judah; and He did that which was good, right, and faithful before Yahweh His God.  [21] In every work that He began in the service of God’s house, in the law, and in the commandments, to seek His God, He did it with all His heart and prospered.\n"

[2] When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come, and that he was planning to fight against Jerusalem,  [3] he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the springs which were outside of the city, and they helped him.  [4] Then many people gathered together and they stopped all the springs and the brook that flowed through the middle of the land, saying, “Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find abundant water?”\n     [5] He took courage, built up all the wall that was broken down, and raised it up to the towers, with the other wall outside, and strengthened Millo in David’s city, and made weapons and shields in abundance.  [6] He set captains of war over the people, gathered them together to him in the wide place at the gate of the city, and spoke encouragingly to them, saying,  [7] “Be strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid or dismayed because of the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude who is with him; for there is a greater one with us than with him.  [8] An arm of flesh is with Him, but Yahweh our God is with us to help us and to fight our battles.” The people rested themselves on the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.\n     [9] After this, Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem, (now he was attacking Lachish, and all his forces were with him), to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah who were at Jerusalem, saying,  [10] Sennacherib king of Assyria says, “In whom do you trust, that you remain under siege in Jerusalem?  [11] Doesn’t Hezekiah persuade you to give you over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, ‘Yahweh our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?’  [12] Hasn’t the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, ‘You shall worship before one altar, and you shall burn incense on it?’  [13] Don’t you know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of those lands in any way able to deliver their land out of my hand?  [14] Who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed that could deliver His people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?  [15] Now therefore don’t let Hezekiah deceive you nor persuade you in this way. Don’t believe Him, for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver His people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you out of my hand?”\n     [16] His servants spoke yet more against Yahweh God and against His servant Hezekiah.  [17] He also wrote letters insulting Yahweh, the God of Israel, and speaking against Him, saying, “As the gods of the nations of the lands, which have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall the God of Hezekiah not deliver His people out of my hand.”  [18] They called out with a loud voice in the Jews’ language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten them and to trouble them, that they might take the city.  [19] They spoke of the God of Jerusalem as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men’s hands.\n     [20] Hezekiah the king and Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, prayed because of this, and cried to heaven.\n     [21] Yahweh sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty men of valor, the leaders, and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So He returned with shame of face to His own land. When He had come into the house of His god, those who came out of His own body killed Him there with the sword.  [22] Thus Yahweh saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria and from the hand of all others, and guided them on every side.  [23] Many brought gifts to Yahweh to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah, so that He was exalted in the sight of all nations from then on.\n     [24] In those days Hezekiah was terminally ill, and He prayed to Yahweh; and He spoke to Him, and gave Him a sign.  [25] But Hezekiah didn’t reciprocate appropriate to the benefit done for him, because his heart was lifted up. Therefore there was wrath on him, Judah, and Jerusalem.  [26] However, Hezekiah humbled Himself for the pride of His heart, both He and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that Yahweh’s wrath didn’t come on them in the days of Hezekiah.\n     [27] Hezekiah had exceedingly great riches and honor. He provided himself with treasuries for silver, for gold, for precious stones, for spices, for shields, and for all kinds of valuable vessels;  [28] also storehouses for the increase of grain, new wine, and oil; and stalls for all kinds of animals, and flocks in folds.  [29] Moreover He provided for Himself cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given Him abundant possessions.  [30] This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon, and brought them straight down on the west side of David’s city. Hezekiah prospered in all his works.\n     [31] However, concerning the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent to Him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left Him to test Him, that He might know all that was in His heart.\n     [32] Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.  [33] Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the ascent to the tombs of the sons of David. All Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him at his death. Manasseh his son reigned in his place.\n"

[3] For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he raised up altars for the Baals, made Asheroth, and worshiped all the army of the sky, and served them.  [4] He built altars in Yahweh’s house, of which Yahweh said, “My name shall be in Jerusalem forever.”  [5] He built altars for all the army of the sky in the two courts of Yahweh’s house.  [6] He also made His children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom. He practiced sorcery, divination, and witchcraft, and dealt with those who had familiar spirits and with wizards. He did much evil in Yahweh’s sight, to provoke Him to anger.  [7] He set the engraved image of the idol, which He had made, in God’s house, of which God said to David and to Solomon His son, “In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever.  [8] I will not any more remove the foot of Israel from off the land which I have appointed for your fathers, if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them, even all the law, the statutes, and the ordinances given by Moses.”  [9] Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did more evil than did the nations whom Yahweh destroyed before the children of Israel.\n     [10] Yahweh spoke to Manasseh and to His people, but they didn’t listen.  [11] Therefore Yahweh brought on them the captains of the army of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh in chains, bound Him with fetters, and carried Him to Babylon.\n     [12] When He was in distress, He begged Yahweh His God, and humbled Himself greatly before the God of His fathers.  [13] He prayed to Him; and He was entreated by Him, and heard His supplication, and brought Him again to Jerusalem into His kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that Yahweh was God.\n     [14] Now after this, he built an outer wall to David’s city on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance at the fish gate. He encircled Ophel with it, and raised it up to a very great height; and he put valiant captains in all the fortified cities of Judah.  [15] He took away the foreign gods and the idol out of Yahweh’s house, and all the altars that He had built in the mountain of Yahweh’s house and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.  [16] He built up Yahweh’s altar, and offered sacrifices of peace offerings and of thanksgiving on it, and commanded Judah to serve Yahweh, the God of Israel.  [17] Nevertheless the people still sacrificed in the high places, but only to Yahweh their God.\n     [18] Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and His prayer to His God, and the words of the seers who spoke to Him in the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel, behold, they are written among the acts of the kings of Israel.  [19] His prayer also, and how God listened to His request, and all His sin and His trespass, and the places in which He built high places and set up the Asherah poles and the engraved images before He humbled Himself: behold, they are written in the history of Hozai.  [20] So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house; and Amon his son reigned in his place.\n     [21] Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.  [22] He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, as did Manasseh His father; and Amon sacrificed to all the engraved images which Manasseh His father had made, and served them.  [23] He didn’t humble Himself before Yahweh, as Manasseh His father had humbled Himself; but this same Amon trespassed more and more.  [24] His servants conspired against him, and put him to death in his own house.  [25] But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against King Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place.\n"

[2] He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, and walked in the ways of David His father, and didn’t turn away to the right hand or to the left.  [3] For in the eighth year of His reign, while He was yet young, He began to seek after the God of David His father; and in the twelfth year He began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, the Asherah poles, the engraved images, and the molten images.  [4] They broke down the altars of the Baals in his presence; and he cut down the incense altars that were on high above them. He broke the Asherah poles, the engraved images, and the molten images in pieces, made dust of them, and scattered it on the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.  [5] He burned the bones of the priests on their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem.  [6] He did this in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, even to Naphtali, around in their ruins.  [7] He broke down the altars, beat the Asherah poles and the engraved images into powder, and cut down all the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel, then returned to Jerusalem.\n     [8] Now in the eighteenth year of His reign, when He had purged the land and the house, He sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder to repair the house of Yahweh His God.  [9] They came to Hilkiah the high priest and delivered the money that was brought into God’s house, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had gathered from the hands of Manasseh, Ephraim, of all the remnant of Israel, of all Judah and Benjamin, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem.  [10] They delivered it into the hands of the workmen who had the oversight of Yahweh’s house; and the workmen who labored in Yahweh’s house gave it to mend and repair the house.  [11] They gave it to the carpenters and to the builders to buy cut stone and timber for couplings, and to make beams for the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.  [12] The men did the work faithfully. Their overseers were Jahath and Obadiah the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to give direction; and others of the Levites, who were all skillful with musical instruments.  [13] Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and directed all who did the work in every kind of service. Of the Levites, there were scribes, officials, and gatekeepers.\n     [14] When they brought out the money that was brought into Yahweh’s house, Hilkiah the priest found the book of Yahweh’s law given by Moses.  [15] Hilkiah answered Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the book of the law in Yahweh’s house.” So Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.\n     [16] Shaphan carried the book to the king, and moreover brought back word to the king, saying, “All that was committed to your servants, they are doing.  [17] They have emptied out the money that was found in Yahweh’s house, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers and into the hand of the workmen.”  [18] Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, “Hilkiah the priest has delivered me a book.” Shaphan read from it to the king.\n     [19] When the king had heard the words of the law, he tore his clothes.  [20] The king commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the son of Micah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying,  [21] “Go inquire of Yahweh for me, and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found; for great is Yahweh’s wrath that is poured out on us, because our fathers have not kept Yahweh’s word, to do according to all that is written in this book.”\n     [22] So Hilkiah and those whom the king had commanded went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe (now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter), and they spoke to her to that effect.\n     [23] She said to them, “Yahweh, the God of Israel says: ‘Tell the man who sent you to me,  [24] “Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will bring evil on this place and on its inhabitants, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah.  [25] Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands, therefore my wrath is poured out on this place, and it will not be quenched.’”’  [26] But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Yahweh, you shall tell Him this, ‘Yahweh, the God of Israel says: “About the words which you have heard,  [27] because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before God when you heard His words against this place and against its inhabitants, and have humbled yourself before me, and have torn your clothes and wept before me, I also have heard you,” says Yahweh.  [28] “Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace. Your eyes won’t see all the evil that I will bring on this place and on its inhabitants.”’”\n    They brought back this message to the king.\n     [29] Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.  [30] The king went up to Yahweh’s house with all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem—the priests, the Levites, and all the people, both great and small—and He read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in Yahweh’s house.  [31] The king stood in His place and made a covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh, and to keep His commandments, His testimonies, and His statutes with all His heart and with all His soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.  [32] He caused all who were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand. The inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.  [33] Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that belonged to the children of Israel, and made all who were found in Israel to serve, even to serve Yahweh their God. All His days they didn’t depart from following Yahweh, the God of their fathers.\n"

          "content": "     [1] Josiah kept a Passover to Yahweh in Jerusalem. They killed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.  [2] He set the priests in their offices and encouraged them in the service of Yahweh’s house.  [3] He said to the Levites who taught all Israel, who were holy to Yahweh, “Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel built. It will no longer be a burden on your shoulders. Now serve Yahweh your God and His people Israel.  [4] Prepare yourselves after your fathers’ houses by your divisions, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.  [5] Stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers’ houses of your brothers the children of the people, and let there be for each a portion of a fathers’ house of the Levites.  [6] Kill the Passover lamb, sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brothers, to do according to Yahweh’s word by Moses.”\n     [7] Josiah gave to the children of the people, of the flock, lambs and young goats, all of them for the Passover offerings, to all who were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bulls. These were of the king’s substance.  [8] His princes gave a free will offering to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the rulers of God’s house, gave to the priests for the Passover offerings two thousand six hundred small livestock, and three hundred head of cattle.  [9] Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for the Passover offerings five thousand small livestock and five hundred head of cattle.\n     [10] So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their divisions, according to the king’s commandment.  [11] They killed the Passover lambs, and the priests sprinkled the blood which they received from their hands, and the Levites skinned them.  [12] They removed the burnt offerings, that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers’ houses of the children of the people, to offer to Yahweh, as it is written in the book of Moses. They did the same with the cattle.  [13] They roasted the Passover with fire according to the ordinance. They boiled the holy offerings in pots, in cauldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the children of the people.  [14] Afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aaron were busy with offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night. Therefore the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests the sons of Aaron.  [15] The singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their place, according to the commandment of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s seer; and the gatekeepers were at every gate. They didn’t need to depart from their service, because their brothers the Levites prepared for them.\n     [16] So all the service of Yahweh was prepared the same day, to keep the Passover, and to offer burnt offerings on Yahweh’s altar, according to the commandment of King Josiah.  [17] The children of Israel who were present kept the Passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.  [18] There was no Passover like that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet, nor did any of the kings of Israel keep such a Passover as Josiah kept—with the priests, the Levites, and all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.  [19] This Passover was kept in the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah.\n     [20] After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates, and Josiah went out against him.  [21] But He sent ambassadors to Him, saying, “What have I to do with you, you king of Judah? I come not against you today, but against the house with which I have war. God has commanded me to make haste. Beware that it is God who is with me, that He not destroy you.”\n     [22] Nevertheless Josiah would not turn His face from Him, but disguised Himself, that He might fight with Him, and didn’t listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.  [23] The archers shot at King Josiah; and the king said to his servants, “Take me away, because I am seriously wounded!”\n     [24] So his servants took him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.  [25] Jeremiah lamented for Josiah, and all the singing men and singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day; and they made them an ordinance in Israel. Behold, they are written in the lamentations.  [26] Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and His good deeds, according to that which is written in Yahweh’s law,  [27] and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.\n"

[2] Joahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.  [3] The king of Egypt removed him from office at Jerusalem, and fined the land one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.  [4] The king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. Neco took Joahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.\n     [5] Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when He began to reign, and He reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. He did that which was evil in Yahweh His God’s sight.  [6] Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against him, and bound him in fetters to carry him to Babylon.  [7] Nebuchadnezzar also carried some of the vessels of Yahweh’s house to Babylon, and put them in His temple at Babylon.  [8] Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah; and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place.\n     [9] Jehoiachin was eight years old when He began to reign, and He reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem. He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight.  [10] At the return of the year, King Nebuchadnezzar sent and brought Him to Babylon, with the valuable vessels of Yahweh’s house, and made Zedekiah His brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.\n     [11] Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.  [12] He did that which was evil in Yahweh His God’s sight. He didn’t humble Himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from Yahweh’s mouth.  [13] He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made Him swear by God; but He stiffened His neck, and hardened His heart against turning to Yahweh, the God of Israel.  [14] Moreover all the chiefs of the priests and the people trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations; and they polluted Yahweh’s house which He had made holy in Jerusalem.\n     [15] Yahweh, the God of their fathers, sent to them by His messengers, rising up early and sending, because He had compassion on His people and on His dwelling place;  [16] but they mocked the messengers of God, despised His words, and scoffed at His prophets, until Yahweh’s wrath arose against His people, until there was no remedy.\n     [17] Therefore he brought on them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young man or virgin, old man or infirm. He gave them all into his hand.  [18] All the vessels of God’s house, great and small, and the treasures of Yahweh’s house, and the treasures of the king and of His princes, all these He brought to Babylon.  [19] They burned God’s house, broke down the wall of Jerusalem, burned all its palaces with fire, and destroyed all of its valuable vessels.  [20] He carried those who had escaped from the sword away to Babylon, and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia,  [21] to fulfill Yahweh’s word by Jeremiah’s mouth, until the land had enjoyed its Sabbaths. As long as it lay desolate, it kept Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.\n     [22] Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that Yahweh’s word by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that He made a proclamation throughout all His kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,  [23] “Cyrus king of Persia says, ‘Yahweh, the God of heaven, has given all the kingdoms of the earth to me; and He has commanded me to build Him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all His people, Yahweh His God be with Him, and let Him go up.’”\n"

[2] Then Jeshua the son of Jozadak stood up with His brothers the priests and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and His relatives, and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings on it, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.  [3] In spite of their fear because of the peoples of the surrounding lands, they set the altar on its base; and they offered burnt offerings on it to Yahweh, even burnt offerings morning and evening.  [4] They kept the feast of booths, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the ordinance, as the duty of every day required;  [5] and afterward the continual burnt offering, the offerings of the new moons, of all the set feasts of Yahweh that were consecrated, and of everyone who willingly offered a free will offering to Yahweh.  [6] From the first day of the seventh month, they began to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh; but the foundation of Yahweh’s temple was not yet laid.  [7] They also gave money to the masons and to the carpenters. They also gave food, drink, and oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea, to Joppa, according to the grant that they had from Cyrus King of Persia.\n     [8] Now in the second year of their coming to God’s house at Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brothers the priests and the Levites, and all those who had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem, began the work and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to have the oversight of the work of Yahweh’s house.  [9] Then Jeshua stood with His sons and His brothers, Kadmiel and His sons, the sons of Judah, together to have the oversight of the workmen in God’s house: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brothers the Levites.\n     [10] When the builders laid the foundation of Yahweh’s temple, they set the priests in their vestments with trumpets, with the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise Yahweh, according to the directions of David king of Israel.  [11] They sang to one another in praising and giving thanks to Yahweh, “For He is good, for His loving kindness endures forever toward Israel.” All the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised Yahweh, because the foundation of Yahweh’s house had been laid.\n     [12] But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers’ households, the old men who had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice. Many also shouted aloud for joy,  [13] so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people; for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard far away.\n"

[5] They hired counselors against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.  [6] In the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.\n     [7] In the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his companions wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in Syrian and delivered in the Syrian language.  [8] Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king as follows.  [9] Then Rehum the chancellor, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions, the Dinaites, and the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Shushanchites, the Dehaites, the Elamites,  [10] and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar brought over and settled in the city of Samaria, and in the rest of the country beyond the River, and so forth, wrote.\n     [11] This is the copy of the letter that they sent:\n    \n    To King Artaxerxes, from your servants, the people beyond the River.\n     [12] Be it known to the king that the Jews who came up from you have come to us to Jerusalem. They are building the rebellious and bad city, and have finished the walls and repaired the foundations.  [13] Be it known now to the king that if this city is built and the walls finished, they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and in the end it will be hurtful to the kings.  [14] Now because we eat the salt of the palace and it is not appropriate for us to see the king’s dishonor, therefore we have sent and informed the king,  [15] that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers. You will see in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful to kings and provinces, and that they have started rebellions within it in the past. That is why this city was destroyed.  [16] We inform the king that if this city is built and the walls finished, then you will have no possession beyond the River.\n    \n     [17] Then the king sent an answer to Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions who live in Samaria, and in the rest of the country beyond the River:\n    \n    Peace.\n    \n     [18] The letter which you sent to us has been plainly read before me.  [19] I decreed, and search has been made, and it was found that this city has made insurrection against kings in the past, and that rebellion and revolts have been made in it.  [20] There have also been mighty kings over Jerusalem who have ruled over all the country beyond the River; and tribute, custom, and toll was paid to them.  [21] Make a decree now to cause these men to cease, and that this city not be built until a decree is made by me.  [22] Be careful that you not be slack doing so. Why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?\n    \n     [23] Then when the copy of King Artaxerxes’ letter was read before Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews, and made them to cease by force of arms.  [24] Then work stopped on God’s house which is at Jerusalem. It stopped until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.\n"

They prophesied to them in the name of the God of Israel.  [2] Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak rose up and began to build God’s house which is at Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God, helping them.\n     [3] At the same time Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, came to them, with Shetharbozenai and their companions, and asked them, “Who gave you a decree to build this house and to finish this wall?”  [4] They also asked for the names of the men were who were making this building.  [5] But the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, and they didn’t make them cease until the matter should come to Darius, and an answer should be returned by letter concerning it.\n     [6] The copy of the letter that Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shetharbozenai, and his companions the Apharsachites who were beyond the River, sent to Darius the king follows.

This work goes on with diligence and prospers in their hands.  [9] Then we asked those elders, and said to them thus, “Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?”  [10] We asked them their names also, to inform you that we might write the names of the men who were at their head.  [11] Thus they returned us answer, saying, “We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth and are building the house that was built these many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished.  [12] But after our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath, He gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house and carried the people away into Babylon.  [13] But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of God.  [14] The gold and silver vessels of God’s house, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem and brought into the temple of Babylon, those Cyrus the king also took out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom He had made governor.  [15] He said to Him, ‘Take these vessels, go, put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let God’s house be built in its place.’  [16] Then the same Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of God’s house which is in Jerusalem. Since that time even until now it has been being built, and yet it is not completed.\n     [17] Now therefore, if it seems good to the king, let a search be made in the king’s treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it is so that a decree was made by Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem; and let the king send His pleasure to us concerning this matter.”\n"

[2] A scroll was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of Media, and in it this was written for a record:\n    \n     [3] In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king made a decree: Concerning God’s house at Jerusalem, let the house be built, the place where they offer sacrifices, and let its foundations be strongly laid, with its height sixty cubits and its width sixty cubits;  [4] with three courses of great stones and a course of new timber. Let the expenses be given out of the king’s house.  [5] Also let the gold and silver vessels of God’s house, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple which is at Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be restored and brought again to the temple which is at Jerusalem, everything to its place. You shall put them in God’s house.\n     [6] Now therefore, Tattenai, governor beyond the River, Shetharbozenai, and your companions the Apharsachites, who are beyond the River, you must stay far from there.  [7] Leave the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place.  [8] Moreover I make a decree regarding what you shall do for these elders of the Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king’s goods, even of the tribute beyond the River, expenses must be given with all diligence to these men, that they not be hindered.  [9] That which they have need of, including young bulls, rams, and lambs, for burnt offerings to the God of heaven; also wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the word of the priests who are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail,  [10] that they may offer sacrifices of pleasant aroma to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king and of His sons.  [11] I have also made a decree that whoever alters this message, let a beam be pulled out from his house, and let him be lifted up and fastened on it; and let his house be made a dunghill for this.  [12] May the God who has caused His name to dwell there overthrow all kings and peoples who stretch out their hand to alter this, to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree. Let it be done with all diligence.\n    \n     [13] Then Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, Shetharbozenai, and their companions did accordingly with all diligence, because Darius the king had sent a decree.\n     [14] The elders of the Jews built and prospered, through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. They built and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the decree of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.  [15] This house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.\n     [16] The children of Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy.  [17] They offered at the dedication of this house of God one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve male goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.  [18] They set the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God which is at Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses.\n     [19] The children of the captivity kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.  [20] Because the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together, all of them were pure. They killed the Passover for all the children of the captivity, for their brothers the priests, and for themselves.  [21] The children of Israel who had returned out of the captivity, and all who had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the nations of the land to seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, ate,  [22] and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy; because Yahweh had made them joyful, and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them, to strengthen their hands in the work of God, the God of Israel’s house.\n"

He was a skilled scribe in the law of Moses, which Yahweh, the God of Israel, had given; and the king granted Him all His request, according to Yahweh His God’s hand on Him.  [7] Some of the children of Israel, including some of the priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants went up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.  [8] He came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.  [9] For on the first day of the first month He began to go up from Babylon; and on the first day of the fifth month He came to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of His God on Him.

[14] Because you are sent by the king and His seven counselors to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of your God which is in your hand,  [15] and to carry the silver and gold, which the king and His counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem,  [16] and all the silver and gold that you will find in all the province of Babylon, with the free will offering of the people and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem.  [17] Therefore you shall with all diligence buy with this money bulls, rams, and lambs with their meal offerings and their drink offerings, and shall offer them on the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem.  [18] Whatever seems good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, do that according to the will of your God.  [19] The vessels that are given to you for the service of the house of your God, deliver before the God of Jerusalem.  [20] Whatever more will be needed for the house of your God, which you may have occasion to give, give it out of the king’s treasure house.\n     [21] I, even I, Artaxerxes the king, make a decree to all the treasurers who are beyond the River, that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, requires of you, it shall be done with all diligence,  [22] up to one hundred talents of silver, and to one hundred cors of wheat, and to one hundred baths of wine, and to one hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much.  [23] Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and His sons?\n     [24] Also we inform you that it shall not be lawful to impose tribute, custom, or toll on any of the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, temple servants, or laborers of this house of God.\n     [25] You, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God that is in your hand, appoint magistrates and judges who may judge all the people who are beyond the River, who all know the laws of your God; and teach Him who doesn’t know them.  [26] Whoever will not do the law of your God and the law of the king, let judgment be executed on Him with all diligence, whether it is to death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.\n    \n     [27] Blessed be Yahweh, the God of our fathers, who has put such a thing as this in the king’s heart, to beautify Yahweh’s house which is in Jerusalem;  [28] and has extended loving kindness to me before the king and His counselors, and before all the king’s mighty princes.

Then I looked around at the people and the priests, and found there were none of the sons of Levi.  [16] Then I sent for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, for Elnathan, for Jarib, for Elnathan, for Nathan, for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib and for Elnathan, who were teachers.  [17] I sent them out to Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia; and I told them what they should tell Iddo and His brothers the temple servants at the place Casiphia, that they should bring to us ministers for the house of our God.  [18] According to the good hand of our God on us they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel, namely Sherebiah, with His sons and His brothers, eighteen;  [19] and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brothers and their sons, twenty;  [20] and of the temple servants, whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites, two hundred twenty temple servants. All of them were mentioned by name.\n     [21] Then I proclaimed a fast there at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek from Him a straight way for us, for our little ones, and for all our possessions.  [22] For I was ashamed to ask of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy on the way, because we had spoken to the king, saying, “The hand of our God is on all those who seek Him, for good; but His power and His wrath is against all those who forsake Him.”  [23] So we fasted and begged our God for this, and He granted our request.\n     [24] Then I set apart twelve of the chiefs of the priests, even Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers with them,  [25] and weighed to them the silver, the gold, and the vessels, even the offering for the house of our God, which the king, His counselors, His princes, and all Israel there present, had offered.  [26] I weighed into their hand six hundred fifty talents of silver, one hundred talents of silver vessels, one hundred talents of gold,  [27] twenty bowls of gold weighing one thousand darics, and two vessels of fine bright bronze, precious as gold.  [28] I said to them, “You are holy to Yahweh, and the vessels are holy. The silver and the gold are a free will offering to Yahweh, the God of your fathers.  [29] Watch and keep them until you weigh them before the chiefs of the priests, the Levites, and the princes of the fathers’ households of Israel at Jerusalem, in the rooms of Yahweh’s house.”\n     [30] So the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver, the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God.\n     [31] Then we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was on us, and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy and the bandits by the way.  [32] We came to Jerusalem, and stayed there three days.  [33] On the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with Him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them were Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, the Levites.  [34] Everything was counted and weighed; and all the weight was written at that time.\n     [35] The children of the captivity, who had come out of exile, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve male goats for a sin offering. All this was a burnt offering to Yahweh.  [36] They delivered the king’s commissions to the king’s local governors and to the governors beyond the River. So they supported the people and God’s house.\n"

[2] Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered Ezra, “We have trespassed against our God, and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land. Yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing.

When He came there, He didn’t eat bread or drank water, for He mourned because of the trespass of the exiles.

It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the wide place in front of God’s house, trembling because of this matter, and because of the great rain.\n     [10] Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have trespassed, and have married foreign women, increasing the guilt of Israel.

Separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign women.”\n     [12] Then all the assembly answered with a loud voice, “We must do as you have said concerning us.

[3] They said to me, “The remnant who are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach. The wall of Jerusalem is also broken down, and its gates are burned with fire.”\n     [4] When I heard these words, I sat down and wept, and mourned several days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven,  [5] and said, “I beg you, Yahweh, the God of heaven, the great and awesome God who keeps covenant and loving kindness with those who love Him and keep His commandments,  [6] let your ear now be attentive and your eyes open, that you may listen to the prayer of your servant which I pray before you at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel your servants, while I confess the sins of the children of Israel which we have sinned against you. Yes, I and my father’s house have sinned.  [7] We have dealt very corruptly against you, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which you commanded your servant Moses.\n     [8] “Remember, I beg you, the word that you commanded your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you trespass, I will scatter you among the peoples;  [9] but if you return to me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens, yet I will gather them from there, and will bring them to the place that I have chosen, to cause my name to dwell there.’\n     [10] “Now these are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power and by your strong hand.  [11] Lord, I beg you, let your ear be attentive now to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants who delight to fear your name; and please prosper your servant today, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.”\n    Now I was cup bearer to the king.\n"

Now I had not been sad before in his presence.  [2] The king said to me, “Why is your face sad, since you are not sick? This is nothing else but sorrow of heart.”\n    Then I was very much afraid.  [3] I said to the king, “Let the king live forever! Why shouldn’t my face be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers’ tombs, lies waste, and its gates have been consumed with fire?”\n     [4] Then the king said to me, “What is your request?”\n    So I prayed to the God of heaven.  [5] I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, I ask that you would send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers’ tombs, that I may build it.”\n     [6] The king said to me (the queen was also sitting by him), “How long will your journey be? When will you return?”\n    So it pleased the king to send me, and I set a time for him.  [7] Moreover I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River, that they may let me pass through until I come to Judah;  [8] and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, that He may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple, for the wall of the city, and for the house that I will occupy.”\n    The king granted my requests, because of the good hand of my God on me.  [9] Then I came to the governors beyond the River, and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.  [10] When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite servant heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly, because a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.\n     [11] So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.  [12] I arose in the night, I and a few men with me. I didn’t tell anyone what my God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem. There wasn’t any animal with me except the animal that I rode on.  [13] I went out by night by the valley gate toward the jackal’s well, then to the dung gate; and I inspected the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and its gates were consumed with fire.  [14] Then I went on to the spring gate and to the king’s pool, but there was no place for the animal that was under me to pass.  [15] Then I went up in the night by the brook and inspected the wall; and I turned back, and entered by the valley gate, and so returned.  [16] The rulers didn’t know where I went, or what I did. I had not as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest who did the work.\n     [17] Then I said to them, “You see the bad situation that we are in, how Jerusalem lies waste, and its gates are burned with fire. Come, let’s build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we won’t be disgraced.”  [18] I told them about the hand of my God which was good on me, and also about the king’s words that He had spoken to me.\n    They said, “Let’s rise up and build.” So they strengthened their hands for the good work.\n     [19] But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite servant, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they ridiculed us and despised us, and said, “What is this thing that you are doing? Will you rebel against the king?”\n     [20] Then I answered them, and said to them, “The God of heaven will prosper us. Therefore we, His servants, will arise and build; but you have no portion, nor right, nor memorial in Jerusalem.”\n"

[2] He spoke before his brothers and the army of Samaria, and said, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they fortify themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, since they are burned?”\n     [3] Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, “What they are building, if a fox climbed up it, he would break down their stone wall.”\n     [4] “Hear, our God, for we are despised. Turn back their reproach on their own head. Give them up for a plunder in a land of captivity.  [5] Don’t cover their iniquity. Don’t let their sin be blotted out from before you; for they have insulted the builders.”\n     [6] So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together to half its height, for the people had a mind to work.\n     [7] But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabians, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward, and that the breaches began to be filled, they were very angry;  [8] and they all conspired together to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to cause confusion among us.  [9] But we made our prayer to our God, and set a watch against them day and night because of them.\n     [10] Judah said, “The strength of the bearers of burdens is fading and there is much rubble, so that we are not able to build the wall.”  [11] Our adversaries said, “They will not know or see, until we come in among them and kill them, and cause the work to cease.”\n     [12] When the Jews who lived by them came, they said to us ten times from all places, “Wherever you turn, they will attack us.”\n     [13] Therefore I set guards in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places. I set the people by family groups with their swords, their spears, and their bows.  [14] I looked, and rose up, and said to the nobles, to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, “Don’t be afraid of them! Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses.”\n     [15] When our enemies heard that it was known to us, and God had brought their counsel to nothing, all of us returned to the wall, everyone to His work.  [16] From that time forth, half of my servants did the work, and half of them held the spears, the shields, the bows, and the coats of mail; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.  [17] Those who built the wall, and those who bore burdens loaded themselves; everyone with one of his hands did the work, and with the other held his weapon.  [18] Among the builders, everyone wore his sword at his side, and so built. He who sounded the trumpet was by me.  [19] I said to the nobles, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, “The work is great and widely spread out, and we are separated on the wall, far from one another.  [20] Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally there to us. Our God will fight for us.”\n     [21] So we did the work. Half of the people held the spears from the rising of the morning until the stars appeared.  [22] Likewise at the same time I said to the people, “Let everyone with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day.”  [23] So neither I, nor my brothers, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me took off our clothes. Everyone took his weapon to the water.\n"

[2] For there were some who said, “We, our sons and our daughters, are many. Let us get grain, that we may eat and live.”  [3] There were also some who said, “We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards, and our houses. Let us get grain, because of the famine.”  [4] There were also some who said, “We have borrowed money for the king’s tribute using our fields and our vineyards as collateral.  [5] Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children as their children. Behold, we bring our sons and our daughters into bondage to be servants, and some of our daughters have been brought into bondage. It is also not in our power to help it, because other men have our fields and our vineyards.”\n     [6] I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.  [7] Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said to them, “You exact usury, everyone of his brother.” I held a great assembly against them.  [8] I said to them, “We, after our ability, have redeemed our brothers the Jews that were sold to the nations; and would you even sell your brothers, and should they be sold to us?” Then they held their peace, and found not a word to say.  [9] Also I said, “The thing that you do is not good. Shouldn’t you walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the nations, our enemies?  [10] I likewise, my brothers and my servants, lend them money and grain. Please let us stop this usury.  [11] Please restore to them, even today, their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that you are charging them.”\n     [12] Then they said, “We will restore them, and will require nothing of them. We will do so, even as you say.”\n    Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do according to this promise.  [13] Also I shook out my lap, and said, “So may God shake out every man from His house, and from His labor, that doesn’t perform this promise; even may He be shaken out and emptied like this.”\n    All the assembly said, “Amen,” and praised Yahweh. The people did according to this promise.\n     [14] Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brothers have not eaten the bread of the governor.  [15] But the former governors who were before me were supported by the people, and took bread and wine from them, plus forty shekels of silver; yes, even their servants ruled over the people, but I didn’t do so, because of the fear of God.  [16] Yes, I also continued in the work of this wall. We didn’t buy any land. All my servants were gathered there to the work.  [17] Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, one hundred fifty men, in addition to those who came to us from among the nations that were around us.  [18] Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep. Also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days a store of all sorts of wine. Yet for all this, I didn’t demand the governor’s pay, because the bondage was heavy on this people.  [19] Remember me, my God, for all the good that I have done for this people.\n"

Let’s meet together in the villages in the plain of Ono.” But they intended to harm me.\n     [3] I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work, so that I can’t come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it and come down to you?”\n     [4] They sent to me four times like this; and I answered them the same way.  [5] Then Sanballat sent his servant to me the same way the fifth time with an open letter in his hand,  [6] in which was written, “It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu says it, that you and the Jews intend to rebel. Because of that, you are building the wall. You would be their king, according to these words.  [7] You have also appointed prophets to proclaim of you at Jerusalem, saying, ‘There is a king in Judah!’ Now it will be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let’s take counsel together.”\n     [8] Then I sent to him, saying, “There are no such things done as you say, but you imagine them out of your own heart.”  [9] For they all would have made us afraid, saying, “Their hands will be weakened from the work, that it not be done.” But now, strengthen my hands.\n     [10] I went to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut in at His home; and He said, “Let us meet together in God’s house, within the temple, and let’s shut the doors of the temple; for they will come to kill you. Yes, in the night they will come to kill you.”\n     [11] I said, “Should a man like me flee? Who is there that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.”  [12] I discerned, and behold, God had not sent Him, but He pronounced this prophecy against me. Tobiah and Sanballat had hired Him.  [13] He was hired so that I would be afraid, do so, and sin, and that they might have material for an evil report, that they might reproach me.  [14] “Remember, my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets that would have put me in fear.”\n     [15] So the wall was finished in the twenty-fifth day of Elul, in fifty-two days.  [16] When all our enemies heard of it, all the nations that were around us were afraid, and they lost their confidence; for they perceived that this work was done by our God.  [17] Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah’s letters came to them.  [18] For there were many in Judah sworn to him because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah as wife.  [19] Also they spoke of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.\n"

[60] All the temple servants and the children of Solomon’s servants were three hundred ninety-two.\n     [61] These were those who went up from Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer; but they could not show their fathers’ houses, nor their offspring, whether they were of Israel:\n     [62] The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda: six hundred forty-two.\n     [63] Of the priests: the children of Hobaiah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name.\n     [64] These searched for their genealogical records, but couldn’t find them. Therefore they were deemed disqualified and removed from the priesthood.  [65] The governor told them not to eat of the most holy things until a priest stood up to minister with Urim and Thummim.\n     [66] The whole assembly together was forty-two thousand three hundred sixty,  [67] in addition to their male servants and their female servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty-seven. They had two hundred forty-five singing men and singing women.  [68] Their horses were seven hundred thirty-six; their mules, two hundred forty-five;  [69] their camels, four hundred thirty-five; their donkeys, six thousand seven hundred twenty.\n     [70] Some from among the heads of fathers’ households gave to the work. The governor gave to the treasury one thousand darics of gold, fifty basins, and five hundred thirty priests’ garments.  [71] Some of the heads of fathers’ households gave into the treasury of the work twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand two hundred minas of silver.  [72] That which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold, plus two thousand minas of silver, and sixty-seven priests’ garments.\n     [73] So the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the people, the temple servants, and all Israel lived in their cities.\n    When the seventh month had come, the children of Israel were in their cities.\n"

[2] Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly, both men and women, and all who could hear with understanding, on the first day of the seventh month.  [3] He read from it before the wide place that was in front of the water gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the women, and of those who could understand. The ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law.  [4] Ezra the scribe stood on a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam.  [5] Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people (for he was above all the people), and when he opened it, all the people stood up.  [6] Then Ezra blessed Yahweh, the great God.\n    All the people answered, “Amen, Amen,” with the lifting up of their hands. They bowed their heads, and worshiped Yahweh with their faces to the ground.  [7] Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law; and the people stayed in their place.  [8] They read in the book, in the law of God, distinctly; and they gave the sense, so that they understood the reading.\n     [9] Nehemiah, who was the governor, Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, “Today is holy to Yahweh your God. Don’t mourn, nor weep.” For all the people wept when they heard the words of the law.  [10] Then He said to them, “Go your way. Eat the fat, drink the sweet, and send portions to Him for whom nothing is prepared, for today is holy to our Lord. Don’t be grieved, for the joy of Yahweh is your strength.”\n     [11] So the Levites calmed all the people, saying, “Hold your peace, for the day is holy. Don’t be grieved.”\n     [12] All the people went their way to eat, to drink, to send portions, and to celebrate, because they had understood the words that were declared to them.\n     [13] On the second day, the heads of fathers’ households of all the people, the priests, and the Levites were gathered together to Ezra the scribe, to study the words of the law.  [14] They found written in the law how Yahweh had commanded by Moses that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month;  [15] and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities and in Jerusalem, saying, “Go out to the mountain, and get olive branches, branches of wild olive, myrtle branches, palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make temporary shelters, as it is written.”\n     [16] So the people went out and brought them, and made themselves temporary shelters, everyone on the roof of His house, in their courts, in the courts of God’s house, in the wide place of the water gate, and in the wide place of Ephraim’s gate.  [17] All the assembly of those who had come back out of the captivity made temporary shelters and lived in the temporary shelters, for since the days of Joshua the son of Nun to that day the children of Israel had not done so. There was very great gladness.  [18] Also day by day, from the first day to the last day, He read in the book of the law of God. They kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according to the ordinance.\n"

[2] The offspring of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers.  [3] They stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of Yahweh their God a fourth part of the day; and a fourth part they confessed and worshiped Yahweh their God.  [4] Then Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani of the Levites stood up on the stairs, and cried with a loud voice to Yahweh their God.\n     [5] Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, “Stand up and bless Yahweh your God from everlasting to everlasting! Blessed be your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise!  [6] You are Yahweh, even you alone. You have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their army, the earth and all things that are on it, the seas and all that is in them, and you preserve them all. The army of heaven worships you.  [7] You are Yahweh, the God who chose Abram, brought Him out of Ur of the Chaldees, gave Him the name of Abraham,  [8] found his heart faithful before you, and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, to give it to his offspring, and have performed your words, for you are righteous.\n     [9] “You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heard their cry by the Red Sea,  [10] and showed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, against all his servants, and against all the people of his land, for you knew that they dealt proudly against them, and made a name for yourself, as it is today.  [11] You divided the sea before them, so that they went through the middle of the sea on the dry land; and you cast their pursuers into the depths, as a stone into the mighty waters.  [12] Moreover, in a pillar of cloud you led them by day; and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light in the way in which they should go.\n     [13] “You also came down on Mount Sinai, and spoke with them from heaven, and gave them right ordinances and true laws, good statutes and commandments,  [14] and made known to them your holy Sabbath, and commanded them commandments, statutes, and a law, by Moses your servant,  [15] and gave them bread from the sky for their hunger, and brought water out of the rock for them for their thirst, and commanded them that they should go in to possess the land which you had sworn to give them.\n     [16] “But they and our fathers behaved proudly, hardened their neck, didn’t listen to your commandments,  [17] and refused to obey. They weren’t mindful of your wonders that you did among them, but hardened their neck, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage. But you are a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, and didn’t forsake them.  [18] Yes, when they had made themselves a molded calf, and said, ‘This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt,’ and had committed awful blasphemies,  [19] yet you in your manifold mercies didn’t forsake them in the wilderness. The pillar of cloud didn’t depart from over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither did the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way in which they should go.  [20] You gave also your good Spirit to instruct them, and didn’t withhold your manna from their mouth, and gave them water for their thirst.\n     [21] “Yes, forty years you sustained them in the wilderness. They lacked nothing. Their clothes didn’t grow old, and their feet didn’t swell.  [22] Moreover you gave them kingdoms and peoples, which you allotted according to their portions. So they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.  [23] You also multiplied their children as the stars of the sky, and brought them into the land concerning which you said to their fathers that they should go in to possess it.\n     [24] “So the children went in and possessed the land; and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands, with their kings and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they pleased.  [25] They took fortified cities and a rich land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns dug out, vineyards, olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance. So they ate, were filled, became fat, and delighted themselves in your great goodness.\n     [26] “Nevertheless they were disobedient and rebelled against you, cast your law behind their back, killed your prophets that testified against them to turn them again to you, and they committed awful blasphemies.  [27] Therefore you delivered them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them. In the time of their trouble, when they cried to you, you heard from heaven; and according to your manifold mercies you gave them saviors who saved them out of the hands of their adversaries.  [28] But after they had rest, they did evil again before you; therefore you left them in the hands of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them; yet when they returned and cried to you, you heard from heaven; and many times you delivered them according to your mercies,  [29] and testified against them, that you might bring them again to your law. Yet they were arrogant, and didn’t listen to your commandments, but sinned against your ordinances (which if a man does, he shall live in them), turned their backs, stiffened their neck, and would not hear.  [30] Yet many years you put up with them, and testified against them by your Spirit through your prophets. Yet they would not listen. Therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.\n     [31] “Nevertheless in your manifold mercies you didn’t make a full end of them, nor forsake them; for you are a gracious and merciful God.\n     [32] Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness, don’t let all the travail seem little before you that has come on us, on our kings, on our princes, on our priests, on our prophets, on our fathers, and on all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day.  [33] However you are just in all that has come on us; for you have dealt truly, but we have done wickedly.  [34] Also our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers have not kept your law, nor listened to your commandments and your testimonies with which you testified against them.  [35] For they have not served you in their kingdom, and in your great goodness that you gave them, and in the large and rich land which you gave before them. They didn’t turn from their wicked works.\n     [36] “Behold, we are servants today, and as for the land that you gave to our fathers to eat its fruit and its good, behold, we are servants in it.  [37] It yields much increase to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins. Also they have power over our bodies and over our livestock, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.  [38] Yet for all this, we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, our Levites, and our priests, seal it.”\n"

These were the chiefs of the priests and of their brothers in the days of Jeshua.\n     [8] Moreover the Levites were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who was over the thanksgiving songs, he and his brothers.  [9] Also Bakbukiah and Unno, their brothers, were close to them according to their offices.  [10] Jeshua became the father of Joiakim, and Joiakim became the father of Eliashib, and Eliashib became the father of Joiada,  [11] and Joiada became the father of Jonathan, and Jonathan became the father of Jaddua.\n     [12] In the days of Joiakim were priests, heads of fathers’ households: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;  [13] of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;  [14] of Malluchi, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;  [15] of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;  [16] of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;  [17] of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai;  [18] of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;  [19] of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;  [20] of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;  [21] of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel.\n     [22] As for the Levites, in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, there were recorded the heads of fathers’ households; also the priests, in the reign of Darius the Persian.  [23] The sons of Levi, heads of fathers’ households, were written in the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib.  [24] The chiefs of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brothers close to them, to praise and give thanks according to the commandment of David the man of God, section next to section.  [25] Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers keeping the watch at the storehouses of the gates.  [26] These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest and scribe.\n     [27] At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem to keep the dedication with gladness, both with giving thanks and with singing, with cymbals, stringed instruments, and with harps.  [28] The sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain around Jerusalem and from the villages of the Netophathites;  [29] also from Beth Gilgal and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built themselves villages around Jerusalem.  [30] The priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified the people, the gates, and the wall.\n     [31] Then I brought the princes of Judah up on the wall, and appointed two great companies who gave thanks and went in procession. One went on the right hand on the wall toward the dung gate;  [32] and after them went Hoshaiah, with half of the princes of Judah,  [33] and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,  [34] Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah,  [35] and some of the priests’ sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph;  [36] and His brothers, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe was before them.  [37] By the spring gate, and straight before them, they went up by the stairs of David’s city, at the ascent of the wall, above David’s house, even to the water gate eastward.\n     [38] The other company of those who gave thanks went to meet them, and I after them, with the half of the people on the wall above the tower of the furnaces, even to the wide wall,  [39] and above the gate of Ephraim, and by the old gate, and by the fish gate, the tower of Hananel, and the tower of Hammeah, even to the sheep gate; and they stood still in the gate of the guard.  [40] So the two companies of those who gave thanks in God’s house stood, and I and the half of the rulers with me;  [41] and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;  [42] and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. The singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.  [43] They offered great sacrifices that day, and rejoiced, for God had made them rejoice with great joy; and the women and the children also rejoiced, so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even far away.\n     [44] On that day, men were appointed over the rooms for the treasures, for the wave offerings, for the first fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them according to the fields of the cities the portions appointed by the law for the priests and Levites; for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites who served.  [45] They performed the duty of their God and the duty of the purification, and so did the singers and the gatekeepers, according to the commandment of David and of Solomon His son.  [46] For in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.  [47] All Israel in the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah gave the portions of the singers and the gatekeepers, as every day required; and they set apart that which was for the Levites; and the Levites set apart that which was for the sons of Aaron.\n"

          "content": "     [1] On that day they read in the book of Moses in the hearing of the people; and it was found written in it that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God forever,  [2] because they didn’t meet the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them to curse them; however, our God turned the curse into a blessing.  [3] It came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated all the mixed multitude from Israel.\n     [4] Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the rooms of the house of our God, being allied to Tobiah,  [5] had prepared for him a great room, where before they laid the meal offerings, the frankincense, the vessels, and the tithes of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, the singers, and the gatekeepers; and the wave offerings for the priests.  [6] But in all this, I was not at Jerusalem; for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king; and after some days I asked leave of the king,  [7] and I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing Him a room in the courts of God’s house.  [8] It grieved me severely. Therefore I threw all Tobiah’s household stuff out of the room.  [9] Then I commanded, and they cleansed the rooms. I brought into them the vessels of God’s house, with the meal offerings and the frankincense again.\n     [10] I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them, so that the Levites and the singers, who did the work, had each fled to his field.  [11] Then I contended with the rulers, and said, “Why is God’s house forsaken?” I gathered them together, and set them in their place.  [12] Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain, the new wine, and the oil to the treasuries.  [13] I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their business was to distribute to their brothers.\n     [14] Remember me, my God, concerning this, and don’t wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for its observances.\n     [15] In those days I saw some men treading wine presses on the Sabbath in Judah, bringing in sheaves, and loading donkeys with wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of burdens which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day; and I testified against them in the day in which they sold food.  [16] Some men of Tyre also lived there, who brought in fish and all kinds of wares, and sold on the Sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.  [17] Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, “What evil thing is this that you do, and profane the Sabbath day?  [18] Didn’t your fathers do this, and didn’t our God bring all this evil on us and on this city? Yet you bring more wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath.”\n     [19] It came to pass that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath. I set some of my servants over the gates, so that no burden should be brought in on the Sabbath day.  [20] So the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares camped outside of Jerusalem once or twice.  [21] Then I testified against them, and said to them, “Why do you stay around the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands on you.” From that time on, they didn’t come on the Sabbath.  [22] I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the Sabbath day. Remember me for this also, my God, and spare me according to the greatness of your loving kindness.\n     [23] In those days I also saw the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab;  [24] and their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews’ language, but according to the language of each people.  [25] I contended with them, cursed them, struck certain of them, plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, “You shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves.  [26] Didn’t Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? Yet among many nations there was no king like Him, and He was loved by His God, and God made Him king over all Israel. Nevertheless foreign women caused even Him to sin.  [27] Shall we then listen to you to do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women?”\n     [28] One of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite; therefore I chased him from me.  [29] Remember them, my God, because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites.\n     [30] Thus I cleansed them from all foreigners and appointed duties for the priests and for the Levites, everyone in his work;  [31] and for the wood offering, at appointed times, and for the first fruits. Remember me, my God, for good.\n"

          "content": "     [1] Now in the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to Ethiopia, over one hundred twenty-seven provinces),  [2] in those days, when the King Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Susa the palace,  [3] in the third year of his reign, he made a feast for all his princes and his servants; the army of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces being before him.  [4] He displayed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, even one hundred eighty days.\n     [5] When these days were fulfilled, the king made a seven day feast for all the people who were present in Susa the palace, both great and small, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace.  [6] There were hangings of white and blue material, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and marble pillars. The couches were of gold and silver, on a pavement of red, white, yellow, and black marble.  [7] They gave them drinks in golden vessels of various kinds, including royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty of the king.  [8] In accordance with the law, the drinking was not compulsory; for so the king had instructed all the officials of his house, that they should do according to every man’s pleasure.\n     [9] Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to King Ahasuerus.\n     [10] On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcass, the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,  [11] to bring Vashti the queen before the king wearing the royal crown, to show the people and the princes her beauty; for she was beautiful.  [12] But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s commandment by the eunuchs. Therefore the king was very angry, and his anger burned in him.\n     [13] Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times (for it was the king’s custom to consult those who knew law and judgment;  [14] and next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king’s face, and sat first in the kingdom),  [15] “What shall we do to Queen Vashti according to law, because she has not done the bidding of the King Ahasuerus by the eunuchs?”\n     [16] Memucan answered before the king and the princes, “Vashti the queen has not done wrong to just the king, but also to all the princes, and to all the people who are in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus.  [17] For this deed of the queen will become known to all women, causing them to show contempt for their husbands when it is reported, ‘King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she didn’t come.’  [18] Today, the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen’s deed will tell all the king’s princes. This will cause much contempt and wrath.\n     [19] “If it pleases the king, let a royal commandment go from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, so that it cannot be altered, that Vashti may never again come before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate to another who is better than she.  [20] When the king’s decree which he shall make is published throughout all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives will give their husbands honor, both great and small.”\n     [21] This advice pleased the king and the princes, and the king did according to the word of Memucan:  [22] for he sent letters into all the king’s provinces, into every province according to its writing, and to every people in their language, that every man should rule his own house, speaking in the language of his own people.\n"

          "content": "     [1] After these things, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus was pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.  [2] Then the king’s servants who served him said, “Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king.  [3] Let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the beautiful young virgins to the citadel of Susa, to the women’s house, to the custody of Hegai the king’s eunuch, keeper of the women. Let cosmetics be given them;  [4] and let the maiden who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.” The thing pleased the king, and he did so.\n     [5] There was a certain Jew in the citadel of Susa whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,  [6] who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.  [7] He brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter; for she had neither father nor mother. The maiden was fair and beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.\n     [8] So, when the king’s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together to the citadel of Susa, to the custody of Hegai, Esther was taken into the king’s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.  [9] The maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness from him. He quickly gave her cosmetics and her portions of food, and the seven choice maidens who were to be given her out of the king’s house. He moved her and her maidens to the best place in the women’s house.  [10] Esther had not made known her people nor her relatives, because Mordecai had instructed her that she should not make it known.  [11] Mordecai walked every day in front of the court of the women’s house, to find out how Esther was doing, and what would become of her.\n     [12] Each young woman’s turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus after her purification for twelve months (for so were the days of their purification accomplished, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet fragrances and with preparations for beautifying women).  [13] The young woman then came to the king like this: whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the women’s house to the king’s house.  [14] In the evening she went, and on the next day she returned into the second women’s house, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch, who kept the concubines. She came in to the king no more, unless the king delighted in her, and she was called by name.\n     [15] Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, came to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s eunuch, the keeper of the women, advised. Esther obtained favor in the sight of all those who looked at her.\n     [16] So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.  [17] The king loved Esther more than all the women, and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.\n     [18] Then the king made a great feast for all his princes and his servants, even Esther’s feast; and he proclaimed a holiday in the provinces, and gave gifts according to the king’s bounty.\n     [19] When the virgins were gathered together the second time, Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate.  [20] Esther had not yet made known her relatives nor her people, as Mordecai had commanded her; for Esther obeyed Mordecai, like she did when she was brought up by him.  [21] In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate, two of the king’s eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, who were doorkeepers, were angry, and sought to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus.  [22] This thing became known to Mordecai, who informed Esther the queen; and Esther informed the king in Mordecai’s name.  [23] When this matter was investigated, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a gallows; and it was written in the book of the chronicles in the king’s presence.\n"

[2] All the king’s servants who were in the king’s gate bowed down and paid homage to Haman, for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai didn’t bow down or pay him homage.  [3] Then the king’s servants who were in the king’s gate said to Mordecai, “Why do you disobey the king’s commandment?”  [4] Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he didn’t listen to them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s reason would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew.  [5] When Haman saw that Mordecai didn’t bow down nor pay him homage, Haman was full of wrath.  [6] But he scorned the thought of laying hands on Mordecai alone, for they had made known to him Mordecai’s people. Therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even Mordecai’s people.\n     [7] In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, and chose the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.  [8] Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom, and their laws are different from other people’s. They don’t keep the king’s laws. Therefore it is not for the king’s profit to allow them to remain.  [9] If it pleases the king, let it be written that they be destroyed; and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who are in charge of the king’s business, to bring it into the king’s treasuries.”\n     [10] The king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews’ enemy.  [11] The king said to Haman, “The silver is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you.”\n     [12] Then the king’s scribes were called in on the first month, on the thirteenth day of the month; and all that Haman commanded was written to the king’s local governors, and to the governors who were over every province, and to the princes of every people, to every province according to its writing, and to every people in their language. It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus, and it was sealed with the king’s ring.  [13] Letters were sent by couriers into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to plunder their possessions.  [14] A copy of the letter, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published to all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day.  [15] The couriers went out in haste by the king’s commandment, and the decree was given out in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Susa was perplexed.\n"

[2] He came even before the king’s gate, for no one is allowed inside the king’s gate clothed with sackcloth.  [3] In every province, wherever the king’s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.\n     [4] Esther’s maidens and her eunuchs came and told her this, and the queen was exceedingly grieved. She sent clothing to Mordecai, to replace his sackcloth, but he didn’t receive it.  [5] Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs, whom he had appointed to attend her, and commanded him to go to Mordecai, to find out what this was, and why it was.  [6] So Hathach went out to Mordecai, to city square which was before the king’s gate.  [7] Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king’s treasuries for the destruction of the Jews.  [8] He also gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Susa to destroy them, to show it to Esther, and to declare it to her, and to urge her to go in to the king to make supplication to him, and to make request before him for her people.\n     [9] Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.  [10] Then Esther spoke to Hathach, and gave him a message to Mordecai:  [11] “All the king’s servants and the people of the king’s provinces know that whoever, whether man or woman, comes to the king into the inner court without being called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the king might hold out the golden scepter, that he may live. I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.”\n     [12] They told Esther’s words to Mordecai.  [13] Then Mordecai asked them to return this answer to Esther: “Don’t think to yourself that you will escape in the king’s house any more than all the Jews.  [14] For if you remain silent now, then relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from another place, but you and your father’s house will perish. Who knows if you haven’t come to the kingdom for such a time as this?”\n     [15] Then Esther asked them to answer Mordecai,  [16] “Go, gather together all the Jews who are present in Susa, and fast for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day. I and my maidens will also fast the same way. Then I will go in to the king, which is against the law; and if I perish, I perish.”  [17] So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.\n"

[2] When the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, she obtained favor in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther came near and touched the top of the scepter.\n     [3] Then the king asked her, “What would you like, queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given you even to the half of the kingdom.”\n     [4] Esther said, “If it seems good to the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.”\n     [5] Then the king said, “Bring Haman quickly, so that it may be done as Esther has said.” So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.\n     [6] The king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, “What is your petition? It shall be granted you. What is your request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.”\n     [7] Then Esther answered and said, “My petition and my request is this.

[2] It was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs, who were doorkeepers, who had tried to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus.  [3] The king said, “What honor and dignity has been given to Mordecai for this?”\n    Then the king’s servants who attended him said, “Nothing has been done for him.”\n     [4] The king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had come into the outer court of the king’s house, to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.\n     [5] The king’s servants said to him, “Behold, Haman stands in the court.”\n    The king said, “Let him come in.”  [6] So Haman came in. The king said to him, “What shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor?”\n    Now Haman said in his heart, “Who would the king delight to honor more than myself?”  [7] Haman said to the king, “For the man whom the king delights to honor,  [8] let royal clothing be brought which the king uses to wear, and the horse that the king rides on, and on the head of which a royal crown is set.  [9] Let the clothing and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes, that they may array the man whom the king delights to honor with them, and have him ride on horseback through the city square, and proclaim before him, ‘Thus it shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!’”\n     [10] Then the king said to Haman, “Hurry and take the clothing and the horse, as you have said, and do this for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king’s gate. Let nothing fail of all that you have spoken.”\n     [11] Then Haman took the clothing and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and had him ride through the city square, and proclaimed before him, “Thus it shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!”\n     [12] Mordecai came back to the king’s gate, but Haman hurried to his house, mourning and having his head covered.  [13] Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, “If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of Jewish descent, you will not prevail against him, but you will surely fall before him.”  [14] While they were yet talking with him, the king’s eunuchs came, and hurried to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.\n"

Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.”\n     [3] Then Esther the queen answered, “If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request.  [4] For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for male and female slaves, I would have held my peace, although the adversary could not have compensated for the king’s loss.”\n     [5] Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen, “Who is he, and where is he who dared presume in his heart to do so?”\n     [6] Esther said, “An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman!”\n    Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.  [7] The king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden. Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen, for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.  [8] Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman had fallen on the couch where Esther was. Then the king said, “Will he even assault the queen in front of me in the house?” As the word went out of the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face.\n     [9] Then Harbonah, one of the eunuchs who were with the king, said, “Behold, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman has made for Mordecai, who spoke good for the king, is standing at Haman’s house.”\n    The king said, “Hang him on it!”\n     [10] So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai.

[2] The king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.\n     [3] Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet and begged him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his plan that he had planned against the Jews.  [4] Then the king held out to Esther the golden scepter. So Esther arose, and stood before the king.  [5] She said, “If it pleases the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and the thing seems right to the king, and I am pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the king’s provinces.  [6] For how can I endure to see the evil that would come to my people? How can I endure to see the destruction of my relatives?”\n     [7] Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, “See, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows because he laid his hand on the Jews.  [8] Write also to the Jews as it pleases you, in the king’s name, and seal it with the king’s ring; for the writing which is written in the king’s name, and sealed with the king’s ring, may not be reversed by any man.”\n     [9] Then the king’s scribes were called at that time, in the third month, which is the month Sivan, on the twenty-third day of the month; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded to the Jews, and to the local governors, and the governors and princes of the provinces which are from India to Ethiopia, one hundred twenty-seven provinces, to every province according to its writing, and to every people in their language, and to the Jews in their writing, and in their language.  [10] He wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king’s ring, and sent letters by courier on horseback, riding on royal horses that were bred from swift steeds.  [11] In those letters, the king granted the Jews who were in every city to gather themselves together and to defend their lives—to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish all the power of the people and province that would assault them, their little ones and women, and to plunder their possessions,  [12] on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.  [13] A copy of the letter, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published to all the peoples, that the Jews should be ready for that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.  [14] So the couriers who rode on royal horses went out, hastened and pressed on by the king’s commandment. The decree was given out in the citadel of Susa.\n     [15] Mordecai went out of the presence of the king in royal clothing of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a robe of fine linen and purple; and the city of Susa shouted and was glad.  [16] The Jews had light, gladness, joy, and honor.  [17] In every province and in every city, wherever the king’s commandment and his decree came, the Jews had gladness, joy, a feast and a holiday.

No one could withstand them, because the fear of them had fallen on all the people.  [3] All the princes of the provinces, the local governors, the governors, and those who did the king’s business helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them.  [4] For Mordecai was great in the king’s house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces, for the man Mordecai grew greater and greater.  [5] The Jews struck all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and with slaughter and destruction, and did what they wanted to those who hated them.  [6] In the citadel of Susa, the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men.  [7] They killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,  [8] Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,  [9] Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha,  [10] the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jews’ enemy, but they didn’t lay their hand on the plunder.\n     [11] On that day, the number of those who were slain in the citadel of Susa was brought before the king.  [12] The king said to Esther the queen, “The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in the citadel of Susa, including the ten sons of Haman; what then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces! Now what is your petition? It shall be granted you. What is your further request? It shall be done.”\n     [13] Then Esther said, “If it pleases the king, let it be granted to the Jews who are in Susa to do tomorrow also according to today’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged on the gallows.”\n     [14] The king commanded this to be done. A decree was given out in Susa; and they hanged Haman’s ten sons.  [15] The Jews who were in Susa gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and killed three hundred men in Susa; but they didn’t lay their hand on the plunder.\n     [16] The other Jews who were in the king’s provinces gathered themselves together, defended their lives, had rest from their enemies, and killed seventy-five thousand of those who hated them; but they didn’t lay their hand on the plunder.  [17] This was done on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of that month they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness.\n     [18] But the Jews who were in Susa assembled together on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth days of the month; and on the fifteenth day of that month, they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.  [19] Therefore the Jews of the villages, who live in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, a holiday, and a day of sending presents of food to one another.\n     [20] Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus, both near and far,  [21] to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month Adar yearly,  [22] as the days in which the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned to them from sorrow to gladness, and from mourning into a holiday; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending presents of food to one another, and gifts to the needy.  [23] The Jews accepted the custom that they had begun, as Mordecai had written to them,  [24] because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast “Pur”, that is the lot, to consume them and to destroy them;  [25] but when this became known to the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked plan, which he had planned against the Jews, should return on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.\n     [26] Therefore they called these days “Purim”, from the word “Pur.” Therefore because of all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and that which had come to them,  [27] the Jews established and imposed on themselves, on their descendants, and on all those who joined themselves to them, so that it should not fail that they would keep these two days according to what was written and according to its appointed time every year;  [28] and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor their memory perish from their offspring.\n     [29] Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim.  [30] He sent letters to all the Jews in the hundred twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus with words of peace and truth,  [31] to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times, as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had decreed, and as they had imposed upon themselves and their descendants in the matter of the fastings and their mourning.  [32] The commandment of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.\n"

[2] There were born to him seven sons and three daughters.  [3] His possessions also were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east.  [4] His sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.  [5] It was so, when the days of their feasting had run their course, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, “It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts.” Job did so continually.\n     [6] Now on the day when God’s sons came to present themselves before Yahweh, Satan also came among them.  [7] Yahweh said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”\n    Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.”\n     [8] Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant, Job? For there is no one like Him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil.”\n     [9] Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing?  [10] Haven’t you made a hedge around him, and around his house, and around all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.  [11] But stretch out your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will renounce you to your face.”\n     [12] Yahweh said to Satan, “Behold, all that He has is in your power. Only on Himself don’t stretch out your hand.”\n    So Satan went out from the presence of Yahweh.  [13] It fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,  [14] that a messenger came to Job, and said, “The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys feeding beside them,  [15] and the Sabeans attacked, and took them away. Yes, they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”\n     [16] While He was still speaking, another also came and said, “The fire of God has fallen from the sky, and has burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”\n     [17] While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The Chaldeans made three bands, and swept down on the camels, and have taken them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you.”\n     [18] While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,  [19] and behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead. I alone have escaped to tell you.”\n     [20] Then Job arose, and tore his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshiped.  [21] He said, “Naked I came out of my mother’s womb, and naked will I return there. Yahweh gave, and Yahweh has taken away. Blessed be Yahweh’s name.”  [22] In all this, Job didn’t sin, nor charge God with wrongdoing.\n"

For there is no one like Him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil. He still maintains His integrity, although you incited me against Him, to ruin Him without cause.”\n     [4] Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “Skin for skin. Yes, all that a man has He will give for His life.  [5] But stretch out your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce you to your face.”\n     [6] Yahweh said to Satan, “Behold, He is in your hand. Only spare His life.”\n     [7] So Satan went out from the presence of Yahweh, and struck Job with painful sores from the sole of His foot to His head.  [8] He took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with, and he sat among the ashes.  [9] Then His wife said to Him, “Do you still maintain your integrity? Renounce God, and die.”\n     [10] But He said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?”\n    In all this Job didn’t sin with His lips.  [11] Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that had come on him, they each came from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and to comfort him.  [12] When they lifted up their eyes from a distance, and didn’t recognize him, they raised their voices, and wept; and they each tore his robe, and sprinkled dust on their heads toward the sky.

generation that didn’t make their hearts loyal,\n    whose spirit was not steadfast with God.\n   [9] The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,\n    turned back in the day of battle.\n   [10] They didn’t keep God’s covenant,\n    and refused to walk in His law.\n   [11] They forgot his doings,\n    his wondrous deeds that he had shown them.\n   [12] He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers,\n    in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.\n   [13] He split the sea, and caused them to pass through.\n    He made the waters stand as a heap.\n   [14] In the daytime he also led them with a cloud,\n    and all night with a light of fire.\n   [15] He split rocks in the wilderness,\n    and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.\n   [16] He brought streams also out of the rock,\n    and caused waters to run down like rivers.\n   [17] Yet they still went on to sin against him,\n    to rebel against the Most High in the desert.\n   [18] They tempted God in their heart\n    by asking food according to their desire.\n   [19] Yes, they spoke against God.\n    They said, “Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?\n   [20] Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out,\n    and streams overflowed.\n  Can he give bread also?\n    Will he provide meat for his people?”\n   [21] Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry.\n    A fire was kindled against Jacob,\n    anger also went up against Israel,\n   [22] because they didn’t believe in God,\n    and didn’t trust in His salvation.\n   [23] Yet he commanded the skies above,\n    and opened

Him.\n    They returned and sought God earnestly.\n   [35] They remembered that God was their rock,\n    the Most High God, their redeemer.\n   [36] But they flattered him with their mouth,\n    and lied to him with their tongue.\n   [37] For their heart was not right with him,\n    neither were they faithful in his covenant.\n   [38] But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn’t destroy them.\n    Yes, many times he turned his anger away,\n    and didn’t stir up all his wrath.\n   [39] He remembered that they were but flesh,\n    a wind that passes away, and doesn’t come again.\n   [40] How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness,\n    and grieved him in the desert!\n   [41] They turned again and tempted God,\n    and provoked the Holy One of Israel.\n   [42] They didn’t remember his hand,\n    nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;\n   [43] how he set his signs in Egypt,\n    his wonders in the field of Zoan,\n   [44] he turned their rivers into blood,\n    and their streams, so that they could not drink.\n   [45] He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;\n    and frogs, which destroyed them.\n   [46] He also gave their increase to the caterpillar,\n    and their labor to the locust.\n   [47] He destroyed their vines with hail,\n    their sycamore fig trees with frost.\n   [48] He also gave over their livestock to the hail,\n    and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.\n   [49] He threw on them the fierceness of his anger,\n    wrath, indignation, and trouble,\n    and a band of angels of evil.\n   [50] He made a path for his anger.\n    He didn’t spare their soul from death,\n    but gave their life over to the pestilence,\n   [51] and struck all the firstborn in Egypt,\n    the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.\n   [52] But he led out his own people like sheep,\n    and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.\n   [53] He led them safely, so that they weren’t afraid,\n    but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.\n   [54] He brought them to the border of his sanctuary,\n    to this mountain, which his right hand had taken.\n   [55] He also drove out the nations before them,\n    allotted them for an inheritance by line,\n    and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.\n   [56] Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,\n    and didn’t keep His testimonies,\n   [57] but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers.\n    They were twisted like a deceitful bow.\n   [58] For they provoked him to anger with their high places,\n    and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.\n   [59] When God heard this, He was angry,\n    and greatly abhorred Israel,\n   [60] so that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh,\n    the tent which he placed among men,\n   [61] and delivered his strength into captivity,\n    his glory into the adversary’s hand.\n   [62] He also gave his people over to the sword,\n    and was angry with his inheritance.\n   [63] Fire devoured their young men.\n    Their virgins had no wedding song.\n   [64] Their priests fell by the sword,\n    and their widows couldn’t weep.\n   [65] Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep,\n    like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.\n   [66] He struck his adversaries backward.\n    He put them to a perpetual reproach.\n   [67] Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph,\n    and didn’t choose the tribe of Ephraim,\n   [68] But chose the tribe of Judah,\n    Mount Zion which he loved.\n   [69] He built his sanctuary like the heights,\n    like the earth which he has established forever.\n   [70] He also chose David his servant,\n    and took him from the sheepfolds;\n   [71] from following the ewes that have their young,\n    he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people,\n    and Israel, his inheritance.\n   [72] So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart,\n    and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.\n"

[4] One generation goes, and another generation comes; but the earth remains forever.  [5] The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, and hurries to its place where it rises.  [6] The wind goes toward the south, and turns around to the north. It turns around continually as it goes, and the wind returns again to its courses.  [7] All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers flow, there they flow again.  [8] All things are full of weariness beyond uttering. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.  [9] That which has been is that which shall be, and that which has been done is that which shall be done; and there is no new thing under the sun.  [10] Is there a thing of which it may be said, “Behold, this is new?” It has been long ago, in the ages which were before us.  [11] There is no memory of the former; neither shall there be any memory of the latter that are to come, among those that shall come after.\n     [12] I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.  [13] I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the sky. It is a heavy burden that God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.  [14] I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and behold, all is vanity and a chasing after wind.  [15] That which is crooked can’t be made straight; and that which is lacking can’t be counted.  [16] I said to myself, “Behold, I have obtained for myself great wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem. Yes, my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.”  [17] I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also was a chasing after wind.  [18] For in much wisdom is much grief; and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.\n"

I also had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all who were before me in Jerusalem.  [8] I also gathered silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces. I got myself male and female singers, and the delights of the sons of men: musical instruments of all sorts.  [9] So I was great, and increased more than all who were before me in Jerusalem. My wisdom also remained with me.  [10] Whatever my eyes desired, I didn’t keep from them. I didn’t withhold my heart from any joy, for my heart rejoiced because of all my labor, and this was my portion from all my labor.  [11] Then I looked at all the works that my hands had worked, and at the labor that I had labored to do; and behold, all was vanity and a chasing after wind, and there was no profit under the sun.\n     [12] I turned myself to consider wisdom, madness, and folly; for what can the king’s successor do? Just that which has been done long ago.  [13] Then I saw that wisdom excels folly, as far as light excels darkness.  [14] The wise man’s eyes are in his head, and the fool walks in darkness—and yet I perceived that one event happens to them all.  [15] Then I said in my heart, “As it happens to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise?” Then I said in my heart that this also is vanity.  [16] For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no memory forever, since in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. Indeed, the wise man must die just like the fool!\n     [17] So I hated life, because the work that is worked under the sun was grievous to me; for all is vanity and a chasing after wind.  [18] I hated all my labor in which I labored under the sun, because I must leave it to the man who comes after me.  [19] Who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have rule over all of my labor in which I have labored, and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity.\n     [20] Therefore I began to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor in which I had labored under the sun.  [21] For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, with knowledge, and with skillfulness; yet he shall leave it for his portion to a man who has not labored for it. This also is vanity and a great evil.  [22] For what does a man have of all his labor and of the striving of his heart, in which he labors under the sun?  [23] For all his days are sorrows, and his travail is grief; yes, even in the night his heart takes no rest. This also is vanity.  [24] There is nothing better for a man than that He should eat and drink, and make His soul enjoy good in His labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.  [25] For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I?  [26] For to the man who pleases Him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner He gives travail, to gather and to heap up, that He may give to Him who pleases God. This also is vanity and a chasing after wind.\n"

[12] I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice, and to do good as long as they live.  [13] Also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all His labor, is the gift of God.  [14] I know that whatever God does, it shall be forever. Nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it; and God has done it, that men should fear before Him.  [15] That which is has been long ago, and that which is to be has been long ago. God seeks again that which is passed away.\n     [16] Moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice, that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, that wickedness was there.

[19] For that which happens to the sons of men happens to animals. Even one thing happens to them. As the one dies, so the other dies. Yes, they have all one breath; and man has no advantage over the animals, for all is vanity.  [20] All go to one place. All are from the dust, and all turn to dust again.  [21] Who knows the spirit of man, whether it goes upward, and the spirit of the animal, whether it goes downward to the earth?”\n     [22] Therefore I saw that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his works, for that is his portion; for who can bring him to see what will be after him?\n"

Pay that which you vow.  [5] It is better that you should not vow, than that you should vow and not pay.  [6] Don’t allow your mouth to lead you into sin.

Yes, he pondered, sought out, and set in order many proverbs.  [10] The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words, and that which was written blamelessly, words of truth.  [11] The words of the wise are like goads; and like nails well fastened are words from the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.  [12] Furthermore, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.\n     [13] This is the end of the matter. All has been heard. Fear God and keep His commandments; for this is the whole duty of man.  [14] For God will bring every work into judgment, with every hidden thing, whether it is good, or whether it is evil.\n"

[3] What will you do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which will come from afar? To whom will you flee for help? Where will you leave your wealth?\n     [4] They will only bow down under the prisoners,\n    and will fall under the slain.\n  For all this his anger is not turned away,\n    but his hand is stretched out still.\n    \n     [5] Alas Assyrian, the rod of my anger, the staff in whose hand is my indignation!

[7] However, he doesn’t mean so, neither does his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off not a few nations.  [8] For he says, “Aren’t all of my princes kings?  [9] Isn’t Calno like Carchemish? Isn’t Hamath like Arpad? Isn’t Samaria like Damascus?”  [10] As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols, whose engraved images exceeded those of Jerusalem and of Samaria,  [11] shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?\n     [12] Therefore it will happen that when the Lord has performed His whole work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the willful proud heart of the king of Assyria, and the insolence of His arrogant looks.  [13] For he has said, “By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom, for I have understanding. I have removed the boundaries of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures. Like a valiant man I have brought down their rulers.  [14] My hand has found the riches of the peoples like a nest, and like one gathers eggs that are abandoned, I have gathered all the earth.

[18] He will consume the glory of his forest and of his fruitful field, both soul and body. It will be as when a standard bearer faints.  [19] The remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few, so that a child could write their number.\n     [20] It will come to pass in that day that the remnant of Israel, and those who have escaped from the house of Jacob will no more again lean on Him who struck them, but shall lean on Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.  [21] A remnant will return, even the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.  [22] For though your people, Israel, are like the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will return. A destruction is determined, overflowing with righteousness.  [23] For the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will make a full end, and that determined, throughout all the earth.\n     [24] Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, says, “My people who dwell in Zion, don’t be afraid of the Assyrian, though He strike you with the rod, and lift up His staff against you, as Egypt did.  [25] For yet a very little while, and the indignation against you will be accomplished, and my anger will be directed to his destruction.”  [26] Yahweh of Armies will stir up a scourge against Him, as in the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb. His rod will be over the sea, and He will lift it up like He did against Egypt.  [27] It will happen in that day that his burden will depart from off your shoulder, and his yoke from off your neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing oil.\n     [28] He has come to Aiath. He has passed through Migron. At Michmash he stores his baggage.  [29] They have gone over the pass. They have taken up their lodging at Geba. Ramah trembles. Gibeah of Saul has fled.  [30] Cry aloud with your voice, daughter of Gallim! Listen, Laishah! You poor Anathoth!  [31] Madmenah is a fugitive. The inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety.  [32] This very day he will halt at Nob. He shakes his hand at the mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.\n     [33] Behold, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will lop the boughs with terror. The tall will be cut down, and the lofty will be brought low.  [34] He will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon will fall by the Mighty One.\n"

The streams of Egypt will be diminished and dried up. The reeds and flags will wither away.

Let them tell you now; and let them know what Yahweh of Armies has purposed concerning Egypt.  [13] The princes of Zoan have become fools. The princes of Memphis are deceived. They have caused Egypt to go astray, those who are the cornerstone of her tribes.  [14] Yahweh has mixed a spirit of perverseness in the middle of her; and they have caused Egypt to go astray in all of its works, like a drunken man staggers in His vomit.  [15] Neither shall there be any work for Egypt, which head or tail, palm branch or rush, may do.  [16] In that day the Egyptians will be like women. They will tremble and fear because of the shaking of Yahweh of Armies’s hand, which He shakes over them.  [17] The land of Judah will become a terror to Egypt. Everyone to whom mention is made of it will be afraid, because of the plans of Yahweh of Armies, which He determines against it.

They will return to Yahweh, and He will be entreated by them, and will heal them.\n     [23] In that day there will be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria; and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians.\n     [24] In that day, Israel will be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing within the earth;  [25] because Yahweh of Armies has blessed them, saying, “Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel my inheritance.”\n"

[21] For Yahweh will rise up as on Mount Perazim. He will be angry as in the valley of Gibeon; that He may do His work, His unusual work, and bring to pass His act, His extraordinary act.  [22] Now therefore don’t be scoffers, lest your bonds be made strong; for I have heard a decree of destruction from the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, on the whole earth.\n     [23] Give ear, and hear my voice! Listen, and hear my speech!  [24] Does he who plows to sow plow continually? Does he keep turning the soil and breaking the clods?  [25] When he has leveled its surface, doesn’t he plant the dill, and scatter the cumin seed, and put in the wheat in rows, the barley in the appointed place, and the spelt in its place?  [26] For His God instructs Him in right judgment and teaches Him.  [27] For the dill isn’t threshed with a sharp instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned over the cumin; but the dill is beaten out with a stick, and the cumin with a rod.  [28] Bread flour must be ground; so he will not always be threshing it. Although he drives the wheel of his threshing cart over it, his horses don’t grind it.  [29] This also comes out from Yahweh of Armies, who is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in wisdom.\n"

Add year to year; let the feasts come around;  [2] then I will distress Ariel, and there will be mourning and lamentation. She shall be to me as an altar hearth.  [3] I will encamp against you all around you, and will lay siege against you with posted troops. I will raise siege works against you.  [4] You will be brought down, and will speak out of the ground. Your speech will mumble out of the dust. Your voice will be as of one who has a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and your speech will whisper out of the dust.\n     [5] But the multitude of your foes will be like fine dust, and the multitude of the ruthless ones like chaff that blows away. Yes, it will be in an instant, suddenly.  [6] She will be visited by Yahweh of Armies with thunder, with earthquake, with great noise, with whirlwind and storm, and with the flame of a devouring fire.  [7] The multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all who fight against her and her stronghold, and who distress her, will be like a dream, a vision of the night.  [8] It will be like when a hungry man dreams, and behold, he eats; but he awakes, and his hunger isn’t satisfied; or like when a thirsty man dreams, and behold, he drinks; but he awakes, and behold, he is faint, and he is still thirsty. The multitude of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion will be like that.\n     [9] Pause and wonder! Blind yourselves and be blind! They are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.  [10] For Yahweh has poured out on you a spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes, the prophets; and He has covered your heads, the seers.  [11] All vision has become to you like the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one who is educated, saying, “Read this, please;” and he says, “I can’t, for it is sealed;”  [12] and the book is delivered to one who is not educated, saying, “Read this, please;” and he says, “I can’t read.”\n     [13] The Lord said, “Because this people draws near with their mouth and honors me with their lips, but they have removed their heart far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment of men which has been taught;  [14] therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder; and the wisdom of their wise men will perish, and the understanding of their prudent men will be hidden.”\n     [15] Woe to those who deeply hide their counsel from Yahweh, and whose deeds are in the dark, and who say, “Who sees us?” and “Who knows us?”  [16] You turn things upside down! Should the potter be thought to be like clay, that the thing made should say about him who made it, “He didn’t make me;” or the thing formed say of him who formed it, “He has no understanding?”\n     [17] Isn’t it yet a very little while, and Lebanon will be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field will be regarded as a forest?  [18] In that day, the deaf will hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind will see out of obscurity and out of darkness.  [19] The humble also will increase their joy in Yahweh, and the poor among men will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.  [20] For the ruthless is brought to nothing, and the scoffer ceases, and all those who are alert to do evil are cut off—  [21] who cause a person to be indicted by a word, and lay a snare for one who reproves in the gate, and who deprive the innocent of justice with false testimony.\n     [22] Therefore Yahweh, who redeemed Abraham, says concerning the house of Jacob: “Jacob shall no longer be ashamed, neither shall His face grow pale.  [23] But when He sees His children, the work of my hands, in the middle of Him, they will sanctify my name. Yes, they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and will stand in awe of the God of Israel.  [24] They also who err in spirit will come to understanding, and those who grumble will receive instruction.”\n"

[3] Therefore the strength of Pharaoh will be your shame, and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.  [4] For their princes are at Zoan, and their ambassadors have come to Hanes.  [5] They shall all be ashamed because of a people that can’t profit them, that are not a help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.”\n     [6] The burden of the animals of the South.\n    Through the land of trouble and anguish, of the lioness and the lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they carry their riches on the shoulders of young donkeys, and their treasures on the humps of camels, to an unprofitable people.  [7] For Egypt helps in vain, and to no purpose; therefore I have called her Rahab who sits still.  [8] Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it in a book, that it may be for the time to come forever and ever.  [9] For it is a rebellious people, lying children, children who will not hear Yahweh’s law;  [10] who tell the seers, “Don’t see!” and the prophets, “Don’t prophesy to us right things. Tell us pleasant things. Prophesy deceits.  [11] Get out of the way. Turn away from the path. Cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.”  [12] Therefore the Holy One of Israel says, “Because you despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and rely on it,  [13] therefore this iniquity shall be to you like a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking comes suddenly in an instant.  [14] He will break it as a potter’s vessel is broken, breaking it in pieces without sparing, so that there won’t be found among the broken pieces a piece good enough to take fire from the hearth, or to dip up water out of the cistern.”\n     [15] For thus said the Lord Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, “You will be saved in returning and rest. Your strength will be in quietness and in confidence.” You refused,  [16] but you said, “No, for we will flee on horses;” therefore you will flee; and, “We will ride on the swift;” therefore those who pursue you will be swift.  [17] One thousand will flee at the threat of one. At the threat of five, you will flee until you are left like a beacon on the top of a mountain, and like a banner on a hill.\n     [18] Therefore Yahweh will wait, that He may be gracious to you; and therefore He will be exalted, that He may have mercy on you, for Yahweh is a God of justice. Blessed are all those who wait for Him.  [19] For the people will dwell in Zion at Jerusalem. You will weep no more. He will surely be gracious to you at the voice of your cry. When he hears you, he will answer you.  [20] Though the Lord may give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet your teachers won’t be hidden any more, but your eyes will see your teachers;  [21] and when you turn to the right hand, and when you turn to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, “This is the way. Walk in it.”  [22] You shall defile the overlaying of your engraved images of silver, and the plating of your molten images of gold. You shall cast them away as an unclean thing. You shall tell it, “Go away!”\n     [23] He will give the rain for your seed, with which you will sow the ground; and bread of the increase of the ground will be rich and plentiful. In that day, your livestock will feed in large pastures.  [24] The oxen likewise and the young donkeys that till the ground will eat savory feed, which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fork.  [25] There will be brooks and streams of water on every lofty mountain and on every high hill in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.  [26] Moreover the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter, like the light of seven days, in the day that Yahweh binds up the fracture of His people, and heals the wound they were struck with.\n     [27] Behold, Yahweh’s name comes from far away, burning with His anger, and in thick rising smoke. His lips are full of indignation. His tongue is as a devouring fire.  [28] His breath is as an overflowing stream that reaches even to the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction. A bridle that leads to ruin will be in the jaws of the peoples.  [29] You will have a song, as in the night when a holy feast is kept, and gladness of heart, as when one goes with a flute to come to Yahweh’s mountain, to Israel’s Rock.  [30] Yahweh will cause His glorious voice to be heard, and will show the descent of His arm, with the indignation of His anger and the flame of a devouring fire, with a blast, storm, and hailstones.  [31] For through Yahweh’s voice the Assyrian will be dismayed. He will strike Him with His rod.  [32] Every stroke of the rod of punishment, which Yahweh will lay on Him, will be with the sound of tambourines and harps. He will fight with them in battles, brandishing weapons.  [33] For His burning place has long been ready. Yes, it is prepared for the king. He has made its pyre deep and large with fire and much wood. Yahweh’s breath, like a stream of sulfur, kindles it.\n"

[6] Behold, you trust in the staff of this bruised reed, even in Egypt, which if a man leans on it, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.

[9] How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put your trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?

Yahweh said to me, “Go up against this land, and destroy it.”’”\n     [11] Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah said to Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Don’t speak to us in the Jews’ language in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.”\n     [12] But Rabshakeh said, “Has my master sent me only to your master and to you, to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, who will eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?”  [13] Then Rabshakeh stood, and called out with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and said, “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!  [14] The king says, ‘Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you.  [15] Don’t let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh, saying, “Yahweh will surely deliver us. This city won’t be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.”’  [16] Don’t listen to Hezekiah, for the king of Assyria says, ‘Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and each of you eat from his vine, and each one from his fig tree, and each one of you drink the waters of his own cistern;  [17] until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.  [18] Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, “Yahweh will deliver us.” Have any of the gods of the nations delivered their lands from the hand of the king of Assyria?  [19] Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand?  [20] Who are they among all the gods of these countries that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Yahweh should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?’”\n     [21] But they remained silent, and said nothing in reply, for the king’s commandment was, “Don’t answer him.”\n     [22] Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.\n"

[2] He sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.  [3] They said to him, “Hezekiah says, ‘Today is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of rejection; for the children have come to the birth, and there is no strength to give birth.  [4] It may be Yahweh your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria His master has sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Yahweh your God has heard. Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.’”\n     [5] So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.\n     [6] Isaiah said to them, “Tell your master, ‘Yahweh says, “Don’t be afraid of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.  [7] Behold, I will put a spirit in him and he will hear news, and will return to his own land. I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.”’”\n     [8] So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah, for he heard that he had departed from Lachish.  [9] He heard news concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, “He has come out to fight against you.” When he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,  [10] “Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, ‘Don’t let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, “Jerusalem won’t be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.”  [11] Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly. Shall you be delivered?  [12] Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the children of Eden who were in Telassar?  [13] Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?’”\n     [14] Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it. Then Hezekiah went up to Yahweh’s house, and spread it before Yahweh.  [15] Hezekiah prayed to Yahweh, saying,  [16] “Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, who is enthroned among the cherubim, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth.  [17] Turn your ear, Yahweh, and hear. Open your eyes, Yahweh, and behold. Hear all of the words of Sennacherib, who has sent to defy the living God.  [18] Truly, Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have destroyed all the countries and their land,  [19] and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.  [20] Now therefore, Yahweh our God, save us from His hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you are Yahweh, even you only.”\n     [21] Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Yahweh, the God of Israel says, ‘Because you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,  [22] this is the word which Yahweh has spoken concerning Him: The virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and ridiculed you. The daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.  [23] Whom have you defied and blasphemed? Against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel.  [24] By your servants, you have defied the Lord, and have said, “With the multitude of my chariots I have come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon. I will cut down its tall cedars and its choice cypress trees. I will enter into its farthest height, the forest of its fruitful field.  [25] I have dug and drunk water, and with the sole of my feet I will dry up all the rivers of Egypt.”\n     [26] “‘Have you not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it in ancient times? Now I have brought it to pass, that it should be yours to destroy fortified cities, turning them into ruinous heaps.  [27] Therefore their inhabitants had little power. They were dismayed and confounded. They were like the grass of the field, and like the green herb, like the grass on the housetops, and like a field before its crop has grown.  [28] But I know your sitting down, your going out, your coming in, and your raging against me.  [29] Because of your raging against me, and because your arrogance has come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in your nose and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came.\n     [30] “‘This shall be the sign to you: You will eat this year that which grows of itself, and in the second year that which springs from it; and in the third year sow and reap and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.  [31] The remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah will again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.  [32] For out of Jerusalem a remnant will go out, and survivors will escape from Mount Zion. The zeal of Yahweh of Armies will perform this.’\n     [33] “Therefore Yahweh says concerning the king of Assyria, ‘He will not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither will He come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.  [34] He will return the way that He came, and He won’t come to this city,’ says Yahweh.  [35] ‘For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.’”\n     [36] Then Yahweh’s angel went out and struck one hundred and eighty-five thousand men in the camp of the Assyrians. When men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.  [37] So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, went away, returned to Nineveh, and stayed there.  [38] As He was worshiping in the house of Nisroch His god, Adrammelech and Sharezer His sons struck Him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. Esar Haddon His son reigned in His place.\n"

[3] It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.

Then Yahweh said to me, “Behold, I have put my words in your mouth.  [10] Behold, I have today set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to uproot and to tear down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.”\n     [11] Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, “Jeremiah, what do you see?”\n    I said, “I see a branch of an almond tree.”\n     [12] Then Yahweh said to me, “You have seen well; for I watch over my word to perform it.”\n     [13] Yahweh’s word came to me the second time, saying, “What do you see?”\n    I said, “I see a boiling cauldron; and it is tipping away from the north.”\n     [14] Then Yahweh said to me, “Out of the north, evil will break out on all the inhabitants of the land.  [15] For behold, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north,” says Yahweh.\n  “They will come, and they will each set His throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem,\n    and against all its walls all around, and against all the cities of Judah.\n   [16] I will utter my judgments against them concerning all their wickedness,\n    in that they have forsaken me,\n    and have burned incense to other gods,\n    and worshiped the works of their own hands.\n     [17] “You therefore put your belt on your waist, arise, and say to them all that I command you. Don’t be dismayed at them, lest I dismay you before them.  [18] For behold, I have made you today a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls against the whole land—against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land.

[16] It will come to pass, when you are multiplied and increased in the land in those days,” says Yahweh, “they will no longer say, ‘the ark of Yahweh’s covenant!’ It will not come to mind. They won’t remember it. They won’t miss it, nor will another be made.  [17] At that time they will call Jerusalem ‘Yahweh’s Throne;’ and all the nations will be gathered to it, to Yahweh’s name, to Jerusalem. They will no longer walk after the stubbornness of their evil heart.  [18] In those days the house of Judah will walk with the house of Israel, and they will come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance to your fathers.\n     [19] “But I said, ‘How I desire to put you among the children, and give you a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the armies of the nations!’ and I said, ‘You shall call me “My Father”, and shall not turn away from following me.’\n     [20] “Surely as a wife treacherously departs from her husband, so you have dealt treacherously with me, house of Israel,” says Yahweh.  [21] A voice is heard on the bare heights, the weeping and the petitions of the children of Israel; because they have perverted their way, they have forgotten Yahweh their God.  [22] Return, you backsliding children, and I will heal your backsliding.\n    “Behold, we have come to you; for you are Yahweh our God.  [23] Truly help from the hills, the tumult on the mountains, is in vain. Truly the salvation of Israel is in Yahweh our God.  [24] But the shameful thing has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.  [25] Let us lie down in our shame, and let our confusion cover us; for we have sinned against Yahweh our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day. We have not obeyed Yahweh our God’s voice.”\n"

Don’t wait; for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.”\n     [7] A lion has gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations. He is on his way.

Surely you have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, ‘You will have peace;’ whereas the sword reaches to the heart.”\n     [11] At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, “A hot wind blows from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow, nor to cleanse.  [12] A full wind from these will come for me. Now I will also utter judgments against them.”\n     [13] Behold, he will come up as clouds, and his chariots will be as the whirlwind. His horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us! For we are ruined.  [14] Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness, that you may be saved. How long will your evil thoughts lodge within you?  [15] For a voice declares from Dan, and publishes evil from the hills of Ephraim:  [16] “Tell the nations, behold, publish against Jerusalem, ‘Watchers come from a far country, and raise their voice against the cities of Judah.  [17] As keepers of a field, they are against her all around, because she has been rebellious against me,’” says Yahweh.  [18] “Your way and your doings have brought these things to you. This is your wickedness, for it is bitter, for it reaches to your heart.”\n     [19] My anguish, my anguish! I am pained at my very heart! My heart trembles within me. I can’t hold my peace, because you have heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.  [20] Destruction on destruction is decreed, for the whole land is laid waste. Suddenly my tents are destroyed, and my curtains gone in a moment.  [21] How long will I see the standard and hear the sound of the trumpet?\n     [22] “For my people are foolish. They don’t know me. They are foolish children, and they have no understanding. They are skillful in doing evil, but they don’t know how to do good.”  [23] I saw the earth and, behold, it was waste and void, and the heavens, and they had no light.  [24] I saw the mountains, and behold, they trembled, and all the hills moved back and forth.  [25] I saw, and behold, there was no man, and all the birds of the sky had fled.  [26] I saw, and behold, the fruitful field was a wilderness, and all its cities were broken down at the presence of Yahweh, before His fierce anger.  [27] For Yahweh says, “The whole land will be a desolation; yet I will not make a full end.  [28] For this the earth will mourn, and the heavens above be black, because I have spoken it. I have planned it, and I have not repented, neither will I turn back from it.”\n     [29] Every city flees for the noise of the horsemen and archers. They go into the thickets and climb up on the rocks. Every city is forsaken, and not a man dwells therein.  [30] You, when you are made desolate, what will you do? Though you clothe yourself with scarlet, though you deck yourself with ornaments of gold, though you enlarge your eyes with makeup, you make yourself beautiful in vain. Your lovers despise you. They seek your life.  [31] For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, the anguish as of her who gives birth to her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, who gasps for breath, who spreads her hands, saying, “Woe is me now!

They will beat down your fortified cities in which you trust with the sword.\n     [18] “But even in those days,” says Yahweh, “I will not make a full end of you.  [19] It will happen when you say, ‘Why has Yahweh our God done all these things to us?’ Then you shall say to them, ‘Just as you have forsaken me and served foreign gods in your land, so you will serve strangers in a land that is not yours.’\n     [20] “Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,  [21] ‘Hear this now, foolish people without understanding, who have eyes, and don’t see, who have ears, and don’t hear:  [22] Don’t you fear me?’ says Yahweh; ‘Won’t you tremble at my presence, who have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it can’t pass it?

He will see this land no more.”\n   [13] “Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness,\n    and his rooms by injustice;\n  who uses his neighbor’s service without wages,\n    and doesn’t give him his hire;\n   [14] who says, ‘I will build myself a wide house and spacious rooms,’\n    and cuts out windows for himself,\n  with a cedar ceiling,\n    and painted with red.\n    \n   [15] “Should you reign because you strive to excel in cedar?\n    Didn’t your father eat and drink,\n    and do justice and righteousness?\n    Then it was well with him.\n   [16] He judged the cause of the poor and needy;\n    so then it was well.\n  Wasn’t this to know me?”\n    says Yahweh.\n   [17] But your eyes and your heart are only for your covetousness,\n    for shedding innocent blood,\n    for oppression, and for doing violence.”\n [18] Therefore Yahweh says concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:\n  “They won’t lament for Him,\n    saying, ‘Ah my brother!’ or, ‘Ah sister!’\n  They won’t lament for Him,\n    saying ‘Ah lord!’ or, ‘Ah His glory!’\n   [19] He will be buried with the burial of a donkey,\n    drawn and cast out beyond the gates of Jerusalem.”\n    \n   [20] “Go up to Lebanon, and cry out.\n    Lift up your voice in Bashan,\n  and cry from Abarim;\n    for all your lovers have been destroyed.\n   [21] I spoke to you in your prosperity,\n    but you said, ‘I will not listen.’\n  This has been your way from your youth,\n    that you didn’t obey my voice.\n   [22] The wind will feed all your shepherds,\n    and your lovers will go into captivity.\n  Surely then you will be ashamed\n    and confounded for all your wickedness.\n   [23] Inhabitant of Lebanon,\n    who makes your nest in the cedars,\n  how greatly to be pitied you will be when pangs come on you,\n    the pain as of a woman in travail!\n     [24] “As I live,” says Yahweh, “though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet on my right hand, I would still pluck you from there.

[4] I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, who went to Babylon,’ says Yahweh; ‘for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’”\n     [5] Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people who stood in Yahweh’s house,  [6] even the prophet Jeremiah said, “Amen! May Yahweh do so. May Yahweh perform your words which you have prophesied, to bring again the vessels of Yahweh’s house, and all those who are captives, from Babylon to this place.  [7] Nevertheless listen now to this word that I speak in your ears, and in the ears of all the people:  [8] The prophets who have been before me and before you of old prophesied against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, of evil, and of pestilence.  [9] As for prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet happens, then the prophet will be known, that Yahweh has truly sent Him.”\n     [10] Then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck, and broke it.  [11] Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, “Yahweh says: ‘Even so I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from off the neck of all the nations within two full years.’” Then the prophet Jeremiah went His way.\n     [12] Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, after Hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,  [13] “Go, and tell Hananiah, saying, ‘Yahweh says, “You have broken the bars of wood, but you have made in their place bars of iron.”  [14] For Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says, “I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they will serve Him. I have also given Him the animals of the field.”’”\n     [15] Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, “Listen, Hananiah! Yahweh has not sent you, but you make this people trust in a lie.  [16] Therefore Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will send you away from off the surface of the earth. This year you will die, because you have spoken rebellion against Yahweh.’”\n     [17] So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.\n"

It said:\n     [4] Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says to all the captives whom I have caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon:  [5] “Build houses and dwell in them. Plant gardens and eat their fruit.  [6] Take wives and father sons and daughters. Take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters. Multiply there, and don’t be diminished.  [7] Seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captive, and pray to Yahweh for it; for in its peace you will have peace.”  [8] For Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says: “Don’t let your prophets who are among you and your diviners deceive you. Don’t listen to your dreams which you cause to be dreamed.  [9] For they prophesy falsely to you in my name. I have not sent them,” says Yahweh.  [10] For Yahweh says, “After seventy years are accomplished for Babylon, I will visit you and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.  [11] For I know the thoughts that I think toward you,” says Yahweh, “thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you hope and a future.  [12] You shall call on me, and you shall go and pray to me, and I will listen to you.  [13] You shall seek me and find me, when you search for me with all your heart.  [14] I will be found by you,” says Yahweh, “and I will turn again your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places where I have driven you, says Yahweh. I will bring you again to the place from where I caused you to be carried away captive.”\n     [15] Because you have said, “Yahweh has raised us up prophets in Babylon,”  [16] Yahweh says concerning the king who sits on David’s throne, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, your brothers who haven’t gone with you into captivity,  [17] Yahweh of Armies says: “Behold, I will send on them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like rotten figs that can’t be eaten, they are so bad.  [18] I will pursue after them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth, to be an object of horror, an astonishment, a hissing, and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them,  [19] because they have not listened to my words,” says Yahweh, “with which I sent to them my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but you would not hear,” says Yahweh.\n     [20] Hear therefore Yahweh’s word, all you captives whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.  [21] Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie to you in my name: “Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and He will kill them before your eyes.  [22] A curse will be taken up about them by all the captives of Judah who are in Babylon, saying, ‘Yahweh make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;’  [23] because they have done foolish things in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives, and have spoken words in my name falsely, which I didn’t command them. I am He who knows, and am witness,” says Yahweh.\n     [24] Concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall speak, saying,  [25] “Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says, ‘Because you have sent letters in your own name to all the people who are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying,  [26] “Yahweh has made you priest in the place of Jehoiada the priest, that there may be officers in Yahweh’s house, for every man who is crazy and makes Himself a prophet, that you should put Him in the stocks and in shackles.  [27] Now therefore, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who makes himself a prophet to you,  [28] because he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, The captivity is long. Build houses, and dwell in them. Plant gardens, and eat their fruit?”’”\n     [29] Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.  [30] Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying,  [31] “Send to all of the captives, saying, ‘Yahweh says concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: “Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, and I didn’t send Him, and He has caused you to trust in a lie,”  [32] therefore Yahweh says, “Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and His offspring. He will not have a man to dwell among this people. He won’t see the good that I will do to my people,” says Yahweh, “because He has spoken rebellion against Yahweh.”’”\n"

[2] Now at that time the king of Babylon’s army was besieging Jerusalem. Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judah’s house.\n     [3] For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut Him up, saying, “Why do you prophesy, and say, ‘Yahweh says, “Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and He will take it;  [4] and Zedekiah king of Judah won’t escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but will surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and will speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes will see his eyes;  [5] and He will bring Zedekiah to Babylon, and He will be there until I visit Him,” says Yahweh, “though you fight with the Chaldeans, you will not prosper?”’”\n     [6] Jeremiah said, “Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,  [7] ‘Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle will come to you, saying, “Buy my field that is in Anathoth; for the right of redemption is yours to buy it.”’”\n     [8] “So Hanamel my uncle’s son came to me in the court of the guard according to Yahweh’s word, and said to me, ‘Please buy my field that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is yours, and the redemption is yours. Buy it for yourself.’\n    “Then I knew that this was Yahweh’s word.  [9] I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel my uncle’s son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.  [10] I signed the deed, sealed it, called witnesses, and weighed the money in the balances to him.  [11] So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, containing the terms and conditions, and that which was open;  [12] and I delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my uncle’s son, and in the presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of the purchase, before all the Jews who sat in the court of the guard.\n     [13] “I commanded Baruch before them, saying,  [14] Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase which is sealed, and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may last many days.’  [15] For Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says: ‘Houses and fields and vineyards will yet again be bought in this land.’\n     [16] Now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to Yahweh, saying,\n    \n     [17] “Ah Lord Yahweh! Behold, you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm. There is nothing too hard for you.  [18] You show loving kindness to thousands, and repay the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them. The great, the mighty God, Yahweh of Armies is your name:  [19] great in counsel, and mighty in work; whose eyes are open to all the ways of the children of men, to give everyone according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings;  [20] who performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even to this day, both in Israel and among other men; and made yourself a name, as it is today;  [21] and brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, with wonders, with a strong hand, with an outstretched arm, and with great terror;  [22] and gave them this land, which you swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey.  [23] They came in and possessed it, but they didn’t obey your voice and didn’t walk in your law. They have done nothing of all that you commanded them to do. Therefore you have caused all this evil to come upon them.\n     [24] “Behold, siege ramps have been built against the city to take it. The city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, of the famine, and of the pestilence. What you have spoken has happened. Behold, you see it.  [25] You have said to me, Lord Yahweh, ‘Buy the field for money, and call witnesses;’ whereas the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.”\n     [26] Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying,  [27] “Behold, I am Yahweh, the God of all flesh. Is there anything too hard for me?  [28] Therefore Yahweh says: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and He will take it.  [29] The Chaldeans, who fight against this city, will come and set this city on fire, and burn it with the houses on whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal, and poured out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke me to anger.\n     [30] “For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, says Yahweh.  [31] For this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day, so that I should remove it from before my face,  [32] because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger—they, their kings, their princes, their priests, their prophets, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.  [33] They have turned their backs to me, and not their faces. Although I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not listened to receive instruction.  [34] But they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.  [35] They built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through fire to Molech, which I didn’t command them. It didn’t even come into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.”\n     [36] Now therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says concerning this city, about which you say, “It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:”  [37] “Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries where I have driven them in my anger, and in my wrath, and in great indignation; and I will bring them again to this place. I will cause them to dwell safely.  [38] Then they will be my people, and I will be their God.  [39] I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me forever, for their good and the good of their children after them.  [40] I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from following them, to do them good. I will put my fear in their hearts, that they may not depart from me.  [41] Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.”\n     [42] For Yahweh says: “Just as I have brought all this great evil on this people, so I will bring on them all the good that I have promised them.  [43] Fields will be bought in this land, about which you say, ‘It is desolate, without man or animal. It is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.’  [44] Men will buy fields for money, sign the deeds, seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in the places around Jerusalem, in the cities of Judah, in the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South; for I will cause their captivity to be reversed,” says Yahweh.\n"

[7] I will restore the fortunes of Judah and Israel, and will build them as at the first.  [8] I will cleanse them from all their iniquity by which they have sinned against me. I will pardon all their iniquities by which they have sinned against me and by which they have transgressed against me.  [9] This city will be to me for a name of joy, for praise, and for glory, before all the nations of the earth, which will hear all the good that I do to them, and will fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that I provide to it.’”\n     [10] Yahweh says: “Yet again there will be heard in this place, about which you say, ‘It is waste, without man and without animal, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant and without animal,’  [11] the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who say, ‘Give thanks to Yahweh of Armies, for Yahweh is good, for His loving kindness endures forever;’ who bring thanksgiving into Yahweh’s house. For I will cause the captivity of the land to be reversed as at the first,” says Yahweh.\n     [12] Yahweh of Armies says: “Yet again there will be in this place, which is waste, without man and without animal, and in all its cities, a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.  [13] In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, in the cities of the South, in the land of Benjamin, in the places around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, the flocks will again pass under the hands of Him who counts them,” says Yahweh.\n     [14] “Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah.\n   [15] “In those days and at that time,\n    I will cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up to David.\n    He will execute justice and righteousness in the land.\n   [16] In those days Judah will be saved,\n    and Jerusalem will dwell safely.\n  This is the name by which she will be called:\n    Yahweh our righteousness.”\n     [17] For Yahweh says: “David will never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel.  [18] The Levitical priests won’t lack a man before me to offer burnt offerings, to burn meal offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.”\n     [19] Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying,  [20] “Yahweh says: ‘If you can break my covenant of the day and my covenant of the night, so that there will not be day and night in their time,  [21] then my covenant could also be broken with David my servant, that he won’t have a son to reign on his throne; and with the Levitical priests, my ministers.  [22] As the army of the sky can’t be counted, and the sand of the sea can’t be measured, so I will multiply the offspring of David my servant and the Levites who minister to me.’”\n     [23] Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying,  [24] “Don’t consider what this people has spoken, saying, ‘Has Yahweh cast off the two families which He chose?’ Thus they despise my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.”  [25] Yahweh says: “If my covenant of day and night fails, if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth,  [26] then I will also cast away the offspring of Jacob, and of David my servant, so that I will not take of his offspring to be rulers over the offspring of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; for I will cause their captivity to be reversed and will have mercy on them.”\n"

[3] You won’t escape out of his hand, but will surely be taken and delivered into his hand. Your eyes will see the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he will speak with you mouth to mouth.

They will lament you, saying, “Ah Lord!” for I have spoken the word,’ says Yahweh.”\n     [6] Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,  [7] when the king of Babylon’s army was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and against Azekah; for these alone remained of the cities of Judah as fortified cities.\n     [8] The word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them,  [9] that every man should let his male servant, and every man his female servant, who is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, go free, that no one should make bondservants of them, of a Jew his brother.  [10] All the princes and all the people obeyed who had entered into the covenant, that everyone should let his male servant and everyone his female servant go free, that no one should make bondservants of them any more. They obeyed and let them go,  [11] but afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids whom they had let go free to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.\n     [12] Therefore Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,  [13] “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: ‘I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying:  [14] At the end of seven years, every man of you shall release his brother who is a Hebrew, who has been sold to you, and has served you six years. You shall let him go free from you. But your fathers didn’t listen to me, and didn’t incline their ear.  [15] You had now turned, and had done that which is right in my eyes, in every man proclaiming liberty to his neighbor. You had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name;  [16] but you turned and profaned my name, and every man caused his servant and every man his handmaid, whom you had let go free at their pleasure, to return. You brought them into subjection, to be to you for servants and for handmaids.’”\n     [17] Therefore Yahweh says: “You have not listened to me, to proclaim liberty, every man to His brother, and every man to His neighbor. Behold, I proclaim to you a liberty,” says Yahweh, “to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine. I will make you be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth.  [18] I will give the men who have transgressed my covenant, who have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before me when they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts:  [19] the princes of Judah, the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the people of the land, who passed between the parts of the calf.

Their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the sky and for the animals of the earth.\n     [21] “I will give Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes into the hands of their enemies, into the hands of those who seek their life and into the hands of the king of Babylon’s army, who has gone away from you.  [22] Behold, I will command,” says Yahweh, “and cause them to return to this city. They will fight against it, take it, and burn it with fire.

[5] I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine, and cups; and I said to them, “Drink wine!”\n     [6] But they said, “We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, ‘You shall drink no wine, neither you nor your children, forever.  [7] You shall not build a house, sow seed, plant a vineyard, or have any; but all your days you shall dwell in tents, that you may live many days in the land in which you live as nomads.’  [8] We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, or our daughters;  [9] and not to build houses for ourselves to dwell in. We have no vineyard, field, or seed;  [10] but we have lived in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.

[3] It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I intend to do to them, that they may each return from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.”\n     [4] Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all Yahweh’s words, which He had spoken to Him, on a scroll of a book.  [5] Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, “I am restricted. I can’t go into Yahweh’s house.  [6] Therefore you go, and read from the scroll which you have written from my mouth, Yahweh’s words, in the ears of the people in Yahweh’s house on the fast day. Also you shall read them in the ears of all Judah who come out of their cities.  [7] It may be they will present their supplication before Yahweh, and will each return from His evil way; for Yahweh has pronounced great anger and wrath against this people.”\n     [8] Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded Him, reading in the book Yahweh’s words in Yahweh’s house.  [9] Now in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem, proclaimed a fast before Yahweh.  [10] Then Baruch read the words of Jeremiah from the book in Yahweh’s house, in the room of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the new gate of Yahweh’s house, in the ears of all the people.\n     [11] When Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all Yahweh’s words,  [12] he went down into the king’s house, into the scribe’s room; and behold, all the princes were sitting there, Elishama the scribe, Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, Elnathan the son of Achbor, Gemariah the son of Shaphan, Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.  [13] Then Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.  [14] Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, “Take in your hand the scroll in which you have read in the ears of the people, and come.”\n    So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand, and came to them.  [15] They said to him, “Sit down now, and read it in our hearing.”\n    So Baruch read it in their hearing.\n     [16] Now when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said to Baruch, “We will surely tell the king of all these words.”  [17] They asked Baruch, saying, “Tell us now, how did you write all these words at his mouth?”\n     [18] Then Baruch answered them, “He dictated all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.”\n     [19] Then the princes said to Baruch, “You and Jeremiah go hide. Don’t let anyone know where you are.”\n     [20] They went in to the king into the court, but they had laid up the scroll in the room of Elishama the scribe. Then they told all the words in the hearing of the king.  [21] So the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it out of the room of Elishama the scribe. Jehudi read it in the hearing of the king, and in the hearing of all the princes who stood beside the king.  [22] Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month, and there was a fire in the brazier burning before him.  [23] When Jehudi had read three or four columns, the king cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier.  [24] The king and his servants who heard all these words were not afraid, and didn’t tear their garments.  [25] Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the scroll; but he would not listen to them.  [26] The king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but Yahweh hid them.\n     [27] Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, after the king had burned the scroll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,  [28] “Take again another scroll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned.  [29] Concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, ‘Yahweh says: “You have burned this scroll, saying, “Why have you written therein, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will cause to cease from there man and animal?’”’  [30] Therefore Yahweh says concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: “He will have no one to sit on David’s throne. His dead body will be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.  [31] I will punish him, his offspring, and his servants for their iniquity. I will bring on them, on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they didn’t listen.”’”\n     [32] Then Jeremiah took another scroll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and many similar words were added to them.\n"

[5] Pharaoh’s army had come out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they withdrew from Jerusalem.\n     [6] Then Yahweh’s word came to the prophet Jeremiah, saying,  [7] “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘You shall tell the king of Judah, who sent you to me to inquire of me: “Behold, Pharaoh’s army, which has come out to help you, will return to Egypt into their own land.

[13] When he was in Benjamin’s gate, a captain of the guard was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are defecting to the Chaldeans!”\n     [14] Then Jeremiah said, “That is false! I am not defecting to the Chaldeans.”\n    But he didn’t listen to him; so Irijah seized Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.

The king asked Him secretly in His house, “Is there any word from Yahweh?”\n    Jeremiah said, “There is.” He also said, “You will be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.”\n     [18] Moreover Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “How have I sinned against you, against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison?  [19] Now where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you, nor against this land?’  [20] Now please hear, my lord the king: please let my supplication be presented before you, that you not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.”\n     [21] Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard.

He will escape with His life and He will live.’  [3] Yahweh says, ‘This city will surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and He will take it.’”\n     [4] Then the princes said to the king, “Please let this man be put to death, because he weakens the hands of the men of war who remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words to them; for this man doesn’t seek the welfare of this people, but harm.”\n     [5] Zedekiah the king said, “Behold, he is in your hand; for the king can’t do anything to oppose you.”\n     [6] Then they took Jeremiah and threw him into the dungeon of Malchijah the king’s son, that was in the court of the guard. They let down Jeremiah with cords. In the dungeon there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire.\n     [7] Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon (the king was then sitting in Benjamin’s gate),  [8] Ebedmelech went out of the king’s house, and spoke to the king, saying,  [9] “My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon. He is likely to die in the place where he is, because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city.”\n     [10] Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, “Take from here thirty men with you, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he dies.”\n     [11] So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took from there rags and worn-out garments, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.  [12] Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, “Now put these rags and worn-out garments under your armpits under the cords.”\n    Jeremiah did so.

Then the king said to Jeremiah, “I will ask you something. Hide nothing from me.”\n     [15] Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I declare it to you, will you not surely put me to death? If I give you counsel, you will not listen to me.”\n     [16] So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, “As Yahweh lives, who made our souls, I will not put you to death, neither will I give you into the hand of these men who seek your life.”\n     [17] Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Yahweh, the God of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘If you will go out to the king of Babylon’s princes, then your soul will live, and this city will not be burned with fire. You will live, along with your house.  [18] But if you will not go out to the king of Babylon’s princes, then this city will be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they will burn it with fire, and you won’t escape out of their hand.’”\n     [19] Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Jews who have defected to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.”\n     [20] But Jeremiah said, “They won’t deliver you. Obey, I beg you, Yahweh’s voice, in that which I speak to you; so it will be well with you, and your soul will live.  [21] But if you refuse to go out, this is the word that Yahweh has shown me:  [22] ‘Behold, all the women who are left in the king of Judah’s house will be brought out to the king of Babylon’s princes, and those women will say,\n  “Your familiar friends have turned on you,\n    and have prevailed over you.\n  Your feet are sunk in the mire,\n    they have turned away from you.”\n     [23] They will bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans. You won’t escape out of their hand, but will be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon. You will cause this city to be burned with fire.’”\n     [24] Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Let no man know of these words, and you won’t die.  [25] But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you, and tell you, ‘Declare to us now what you have said to the king; don’t hide it from us, and we will not put you to death; also tell us what the king said to you;’  [26] then you shall tell them, ‘I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan’s house, to die there.’”\n     [27] Then all the princes came to Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded.

[10] But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, who had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.\n     [11] Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon commanded Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard concerning Jeremiah, saying,  [12] “Take him and take care of him. Do him no harm; but do to him even as he tells you.”\n     [13] So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, Nebushazban, Rabsaris, and Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon  [14] sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should bring him home. So he lived among the people.\n     [15] Now Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah while He was shut up in the court of the guard, saying,  [16] “Go, and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: “Behold, I will bring my words on this city for evil, and not for good; and they will be accomplished before you in that day.  [17] But I will deliver you in that day,” says Yahweh; “and you will not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid.  [18] For I will surely save you. You won’t fall by the sword, but you will escape with your life, because you have put your trust in me,” says Yahweh.’”\n"

[2] The captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to Him, “Yahweh your God pronounced this evil on this place;  [3] and Yahweh has brought it, and done according as He spoke. Because you have sinned against Yahweh, and have not obeyed His voice, therefore this thing has come on you.  [4] Now, behold, I release you today from the chains which are on your hand. If it seems good to you to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will take care of you; but if it seems bad to you to come with me into Babylon, don’t. Behold, all the land is before you. Where it seems good and right to you to go, go there.”  [5] Now while he had not yet gone back, “Go back then,” he said, “to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or go wherever it seems right to you to go.”\n    So the captain of the guard gave him food and a present, and let him go.  [6] Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and lived with him among the people who were left in the land.\n     [7] Now when all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to him men, women, children, and of the poorest of the land, of those who were not carried away captive to Babylon,  [8] then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men came to Gedaliah to Mizpah.  [9] Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore to them and to their men, saying, “Don’t be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you.  [10] As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans who will come to us; but you, gather wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken.”\n     [11] Likewise when all the Jews who were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and who were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan,  [12] then all the Jews returned out of all places where they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, to Mizpah, and gathered very much wine and summer fruits.\n     [13] Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,  [14] and said to him, “Do you know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?”\n    But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam didn’t believe them.\n     [15] Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, “Please let me go, and I will kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man will know it. Why should he take your life, that all the Jews who are gathered to you should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?”\n     [16] But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, “You shall not do this thing, for you speak falsely of Ishmael.”\n"

[2] Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah arose, and the ten men who were with him, and struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword and killed him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.  [3] Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, and the Chaldean men of war who were found there.\n     [4] The second day after he had killed Gedaliah, and no man knew it,  [5] men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even eighty men, having their beards shaved and their clothes torn, and having cut themselves, with meal offerings and frankincense in their hand, to bring them to Yahweh’s house.  [6] Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went, and as he met them, he said to them, “Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.”  [7] It was so, when they came into the middle of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah killed them, and cast them into the middle of the pit, he, and the men who were with him.  [8] But ten men were found among those who said to Ishmael, “Don’t kill us; for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey.”\n    So he stopped, and didn’t kill them among their brothers.  [9] Now the pit in which Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had killed, by the side of Gedaliah (this was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel), Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with those who were killed.\n     [10] Then Ishmael carried away captive all of the people who were left in Mizpah, even the king’s daughters, and all the people who remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the children of Ammon.\n     [11] But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,  [12] then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.  [13] Now when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, then they were glad.  [14] So all the people who Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah.  [15] But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the children of Ammon.\n     [16] Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces who were with him took all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after he had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam—the men of war, with the women, the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon.  [17] They departed and lived in Geruth Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt  [18] because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor over the land.\n"

Behold, today they are a desolation, and no man dwells in them,  [3] because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, to serve other gods that they didn’t know, neither they, nor you, nor your fathers.

They didn’t turn from their wickedness, to stop burning incense to other gods.  [6] Therefore my wrath and my anger was poured out, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as it is today.’\n     [7] “Therefore now Yahweh, the God of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Why do you commit great evil against your own souls, to cut off from yourselves man and woman, infant and nursing child out of the middle of Judah, to leave yourselves no one remaining,  [8] in that you provoke me to anger with the works of your hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have gone to live, that you may be cut off, and that you may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?  [9] Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, the wickedness of the kings of Judah, the wickedness of their wives, your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?  [10] They are not humbled even to this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.’\n     [11] “Therefore Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, even to cut off all Judah.  [12] I will take the remnant of Judah that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to live there, and they will all be consumed. They will fall in the land of Egypt.

[17] But we will certainly perform every word that has gone out of our mouth, to burn incense to the queen of the sky and to pour out drink offerings to her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then we had plenty of food, and were well, and saw no evil.  [18] But since we stopped burning incense to the queen of the sky, and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.”\n     [19] The women said, “When we burned incense to the queen of the sky and poured out drink offerings to her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings to her, without our husbands?”\n     [20] Then Jeremiah said to all the people—to the men and to the women, even to all the people who had given him an answer, saying,  [21] “The incense that you burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, didn’t Yahweh remember them, and didn’t it come into His mind?  [22] Thus Yahweh could no longer bear it, because of the evil of your doings and because of the abominations which you have committed. Therefore your land has become a desolation, an astonishment, and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is today.  [23] Because you have burned incense and because you have sinned against Yahweh, and have not obeyed Yahweh’s voice, nor walked in His law, nor in His statutes, nor in His testimonies; therefore this evil has happened to you, as it is today.”\n     [24] Moreover Jeremiah said to all the people, including all the women, “Hear Yahweh’s word, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt!  [25] Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says, ‘You and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and with your hands have fulfilled it, saying, “We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of the sky, and to pour out drink offerings to her.”\n    “‘Establish then your vows, and perform your vows.’\n     [26] “Therefore hear Yahweh’s word, all Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt: ‘Behold, I have sworn by my great name,’ says Yahweh, ‘that my name will no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, “As the Lord Yahweh lives.”  [27] Behold, I watch over them for evil, and not for good; and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt will be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until they are all gone.  [28] Those who escape the sword will return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah few in number. All the remnant of Judah, who have gone into the land of Egypt to live there, will know whose word will stand, mine or theirs.\n     [29] “‘This will be the sign to you,’ says Yahweh, ‘that I will punish you in this place, that you may know that my words will surely stand against you for evil.’  [30] Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of His enemies and into the hand of those who seek His life, just as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who was His enemy and sought His life.’”\n"

in the rock.\n    Be like the dove that makes her nest over the mouth of the abyss.\n    \n   [29] “We have heard of the pride of Moab.\n    He is very proud in his loftiness, his pride,\n    his

sackcloth on the waist.\n   [38] On all the housetops of Moab,\n    and in its streets, there is lamentation everywhere;\n    for I have broken Moab like a vessel in which no one delights,” says Yahweh.\n   [39] “How it is broken down!\n    How they wail!\n  How Moab has turned the back with shame!\n    So will Moab become a derision\n    and a terror to all who are around him.”\n   [40] For Yahweh says: “Behold, He will fly as an eagle,\n    and will spread out His wings against Moab.\n   [41] Kerioth is taken,\n    and the strongholds are seized.\n  The heart of the mighty men of Moab at that day\n    will be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.\n   [42] Moab will be destroyed from being a people,\n    because He has magnified Himself against Yahweh.\n   [43] Terror, the pit, and the snare are on you,\n    inhabitant of Moab,” says Yahweh.\n   [44] “He who flees from the terror will fall into the pit;\n    and He who gets up out of the pit will be taken in the snare,\n  for I will bring on Him, even on Moab,\n    the year of their visitation,” says Yahweh.\n    \n   [45] “Those who fled stand without strength under the shadow of Heshbon;\n    for a fire has gone out of Heshbon,\n    and a flame from the middle of Sihon,\n  and has devoured the corner of Moab,\n    and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.\n   [46] Woe to you, O Moab!\n    The people of Chemosh are undone;\n  for your sons are taken away captive,\n    and your daughters into captivity.\n    \n   [47] “Yet I will reverse the captivity of Moab in the latter days,”\n    says Yahweh.\n

destroy it;\n  for it is the vengeance of Yahweh,\n    the vengeance of His temple.\n   [12] Set up a standard against the walls of Babylon!\n    Make the watch strong!\n  Set the watchmen,\n    and prepare the ambushes;\n  for Yahweh has both purposed and done\n    that which He spoke concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.\n   [13] You who dwell on many waters, abundant in treasures,\n    your end has come, the measure of your covetousness.\n   [14] Yahweh of Armies has sworn by Himself, saying,\n    ‘Surely I will fill you with men,\n    as with locusts,\n    and they will lift up a shout against you.’\n    \n   [15] “He has made the earth by his power.\n    He has established the world by his wisdom.\n    By his understanding he has stretched out the heavens.\n   [16] When he utters his voice,\n    there is a roar of waters in the heavens,\n    and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth.\n  He makes lightning for the rain,\n    and brings the wind out of his treasuries.\n    \n   [17] “Every man has become stupid and without knowledge.\n    Every goldsmith is disappointed by his image,\n  for his molten images are falsehood,\n    and there is no breath in them.\n   [18] They are vanity,\n    a work of delusion.\n    In the time of their visitation, they will perish.\n   [19] The portion of Jacob is not like these,\n    for He formed all things,\n    including the tribe of His inheritance.\n    Yahweh of Armies is His name.\n    \n   [20] “You are my battle ax and weapons of war.\n    With you I will break the nations into pieces.\n    With you I will destroy kingdoms.\n   [21] With you I will break in pieces\n    the horse and his rider.\n   [22] With you I will break in pieces\n    the chariot and him who rides therein.\n  With you I will break in pieces\n    man and woman.\n  With you I will break in pieces\n    the old man and the youth.\n  With you I will break in pieces\n    the young man and the virgin.\n   [23] With you I will

render to Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight,” says Yahweh.\n   [25] “Behold, I am against you, destroying mountain,” says Yahweh,\n    “which destroys all the earth.\n  I will stretch out my hand on you,\n    roll you down from the rocks,\n    and will make you a burned mountain.\n   [26] They won’t take a cornerstone from you,\n    nor a stone for foundations;\n    but you will be desolate forever,” says Yahweh.\n    \n   [27] “Set up a standard in the land!\n    Blow the trumpet among the nations!\n  Prepare the nations against her!\n    Call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz!\n  Appoint a marshal against her!\n    Cause the horses to come up as the swarming locusts!\n   [28] Prepare against her the nations,\n    the kings of the Medes, its governors, and all its deputies, and all the land of their dominion!\n   [29] The land trembles and is in pain;\n    for the purposes of Yahweh against Babylon stand,\n    to make the land of Babylon a desolation, without inhabitant.\n   [30] The mighty men of Babylon have stopped fighting,\n    they remain in their strongholds.\n  Their might has failed.\n    They have become as women.\n  Her dwelling places are set on fire.\n    Her bars are broken.\n   [31] One runner will run to meet another,\n    and one messenger to meet another,\n    to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken on every quarter.\n   [32] So the passages are seized.\n    They have burned the reeds with fire.\n    The men of war are frightened.”\n     [33] For Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says:\n  “The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time when it is trodden.\n    Yet a little while, and the time of harvest comes for her.”\n    \n   [34] “Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me.\n    He has crushed me.\n    He has made me an empty vessel.\n  He has, like a monster, swallowed me up.\n    He has filled his mouth with my delicacies.\n    He has cast me out.\n   [35] May the violence done to me and to my flesh be on Babylon!”\n    the inhabitant of Zion will say; and,\n  “May my blood be on the inhabitants of Chaldea!”\n    will Jerusalem say.\n    \n     [36] Therefore Yahweh says:\n  “Behold, I will plead your cause,\n    and take vengeance for you.\n  I will dry up her sea,\n    and make her fountain dry.\n   [37] Babylon will become heaps,\n    a dwelling place for jackals,\n    an astonishment, and a hissing,\n    without inhabitant.\n   [38] They will roar together like young lions.\n    They will growl as lions’ cubs.\n   [39] When they are inflamed, I will make their feast,\n    and I will make them drunk,\n  that they may rejoice,\n    and sleep a perpetual sleep,\n    and not wake up,” says Yahweh.\n    \n   [40] “I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter,\n    like rams with male goats.\n    \n   [41] “How Sheshach is taken!\n    How the praise of the whole earth is seized!\n    How Babylon has become a desolation among the nations!\n   [42] The sea has come up on Babylon.\n    She is covered with the multitude of its waves.\n   [43] Her cities have become a desolation,\n    a dry land, and a desert,\n    a land in which no man dwells.\n    No son of man passes by it.\n   [44] I will execute judgment on Bel in Babylon,\n    and I will bring out of his mouth that which he has swallowed up.\n  The nations will not flow any more to him.\n    Yes, the wall of Babylon will fall.\n    \n   [45] “My people, go away from the middle of her,\n    and each of you save yourselves from Yahweh’s fierce anger.\n   [46] Don’t let your heart faint.\n    Don’t fear for the news that will be heard in the land.\n  For news will come one year,\n    and after that in another year news will come,\n    and violence in the land,\n    ruler against ruler.\n   [47] Therefore behold, the days come that I will execute judgment on the engraved images of Babylon;\n    and her whole land will be confounded.\n    All her slain will fall in the middle of her.\n   [48] Then the heavens and the earth,\n    and all that is therein,\n  will sing for joy over Babylon;\n    for the destroyers will come to her from the north,” says Yahweh.\n    \n   [49] “As Babylon has caused the slain of Israel to fall,\n    so the slain of all the land will fall at Babylon.\n   [50] You who have escaped the sword, go!\n    Don’t stand still!\n  Remember Yahweh from afar,\n    and let Jerusalem come into your mind.”\n    \n   [51] “We are confounded\n    because we have heard reproach.\n  Confusion has covered our faces,\n    for strangers have come into the sanctuaries of Yahweh’s house.”\n    \n   [52] “Therefore behold, the days come,” says Yahweh,\n    “that I will execute judgment on her engraved images;\n    and through all her land the wounded will groan.\n   [53] Though Babylon should mount up to the sky,\n    and though she should fortify the height of her strength,\n    yet destroyers will come to her from me,” says Yahweh.\n    \n   [54] “The sound of a cry comes from Babylon,\n    and of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!\n   [55] For Yahweh lays Babylon waste,\n    and destroys out of her the great voice!\n  Their waves roar like many waters.\n    The noise of their voice is uttered.\n   [56] For the destroyer has come on her,\n    even on Babylon.\n  Her mighty men are taken.\n    Their bows are broken in pieces,\n  for Yahweh is a God of retribution.\n    He will surely repay.\n   [57] I will make her princes, her wise men,\n    her governors, her deputies, and her mighty men drunk.\n  They will sleep a perpetual sleep,\n    and not wake up,”\n    says the King, whose name is Yahweh of Armies.\n     [58] Yahweh of Armies says:\n  “The wide walls of Babylon will be utterly overthrown.\n    Her high gates will be burned with fire.\n  The peoples will labor for vanity,\n    and the nations for the fire;\n    and they will be weary.”\n     [59] The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Seraiah was chief quartermaster.  [60] Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come on Babylon, even all these words that are written concerning Babylon.  [61] Jeremiah said to Seraiah, “When you come to Babylon, then see that you read all these words,  [62] and say, ‘Yahweh, you have spoken concerning this place, to cut it off, that no one will dwell in it, neither man nor animal, but that it will be desolate forever.’  [63] It will be, when you have finished reading this book, that you shall bind a stone to it, and cast it into the middle of the Euphrates.  [64] Then you shall say, ‘Thus will Babylon sink, and will not rise again because of the evil that I will bring on her; and they will be weary.’”\n    Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.\n"

          "content": "     [1] Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign. He reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.  [2] He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.  [3] For through Yahweh’s anger this happened in Jerusalem and Judah, until He had cast them out from His presence.\n    Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.  [4] In the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about.  [5] So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.\n     [6] In the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.  [7] Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled, and went out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s garden. Now the Chaldeans were against the city all around. The men of war went toward the Arabah,  [8] but the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.  [9] Then they took the king, and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he pronounced judgment on him.  [10] The king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. He also killed all the princes of Judah in Riblah.  [11] He put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison until the day of his death.\n     [12] Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, who stood before the king of Babylon, came into Jerusalem.  [13] He burned Yahweh’s house, and the king’s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, He burned with fire.  [14] All the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem all around.  [15] Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the poorest of the people, and the rest of the people who were left in the city, and those who fell away, who defected to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.  [16] But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vineyard keepers and farmers.\n     [17] The Chaldeans broke the pillars of bronze that were in Yahweh’s house and the bases and the bronze sea that were in Yahweh’s house in pieces, and carried all of their bronze to Babylon.  [18] They also took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the basins, the spoons, and all the vessels of bronze with which they ministered.  [19] The captain of the guard took away the cups, the fire pans, the basins, the pots, the lamp stands, the spoons, and the bowls; that which was of gold, as gold, and that which was of silver, as silver.\n     [20] They took the two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve bronze bulls that were under the bases, which King Solomon had made for Yahweh’s house. The bronze of all these vessels was without weight.  [21] As for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a line of twelve cubits encircled it; and its thickness was four fingers. It was hollow.  [22] A capital of bronze was on it; and the height of the one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates on the capital all around, all of bronze. The second pillar also had the same, with pomegranates.  [23] There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates were one hundred on the network all around.\n     [24] The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold,  [25] and out of the city he took an officer who was set over the men of war; and seven men of those who saw the king’s face, who were found in the city; and the scribe of the captain of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the middle of the city.  [26] Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.  [27] The king of Babylon struck them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath.\n    So Judah was carried away captive out of his land.  [28] This is the number of the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive:\nin the seventh year, three thousand twenty-three Jews;\n [29] in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty-two persons;\n [30] in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty-five people.\nAll the people numbered four thousand six hundred.\n     [31] In the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the twenty-fifth day of the month, Evilmerodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and released him from prison.  [32] He spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon,  [33] and changed his prison garments. Jehoiachin ate bread before him continually all the days of his life.  [34] For his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him by the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.\n"

[5] Out of its center came the likeness of four living creatures. This was their appearance: They had the likeness of a man.  [6] Everyone had four faces, and each one of them had four wings.  [7] Their feet were straight feet. The sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot; and they sparkled like burnished bronze.  [8] They had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides. The four of them had their faces and their wings like this:  [9] Their wings were joined to one another. They didn’t turn when they went. Each one went straight forward.\n     [10] As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man. The four of them had the face of a lion on the right side. The four of them had the face of an ox on the left side. The four of them also had the face of an eagle.  [11] Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above. Two wings of each one touched another, and two covered their bodies.  [12] Each one went straight forward. Where the spirit was to go, they went. They didn’t turn when they went.  [13] As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches. The fire went up and down among the living creatures. The fire was bright, and lightning went out of the fire.  [14] The living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.\n     [15] Now as I saw the living creatures, behold, there was one wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, for each of the four faces of it.  [16] The appearance of the wheels and their work was like a beryl. The four of them had one likeness. Their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel.  [17] When they went, they went in their four directions. They didn’t turn when they went.  [18] As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and the four of them had their rims full of eyes all around.\n     [19] When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them. When the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.  [20] Wherever the spirit was to go, they went. The spirit was to go there. The wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.  [21] When those went, these went. When those stood, these stood. When those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.\n     [22] Over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of an expanse, like an awesome crystal to look at, stretched out over their heads above.  [23] Under the expanse, their wings were straight, one toward the other. Each one had two which covered on this side, and each one had two which covered their bodies on that side.  [24] When they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of an army. When they stood, they let down their wings.\n     [25] There was a voice above the expanse that was over their heads. When they stood, they let down their wings.  [26] Above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone. On the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man on it above.  [27] I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within it all around, from the appearance of his waist and upward; and from the appearance of his waist and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness around him.  [28] As the appearance of the rainbow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all around.\n    This was the appearance of the likeness of Yahweh’s glory. When I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke.\n"

It was as sweet as honey in my mouth.\n     [4] He said to me, “Son of man, go to the house of Israel, and speak my words to them.  [5] For you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel—  [6] not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words you can’t understand. Surely, if I sent you to them, they would listen to you.  [7] But the house of Israel will not listen to you, for they will not listen to me; for all the house of Israel are obstinate and hard-hearted.  [8] Behold, I have made your face hard against their faces, and your forehead hard against their foreheads.  [9] I have made your forehead as a diamond, harder than flint. Don’t be afraid of them, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.”\n     [10] Moreover he said to me, “Son of man, receive in your heart and hear with your ears all my words that I speak to you.

[14] So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; and Yahweh’s hand was strong on me.  [15] Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel Aviv who lived by the river Chebar, and to where they lived; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.\n     [16] At the end of seven days, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,  [17] “Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel. Therefore hear the word from my mouth, and warn them from me.  [18] When I tell the wicked, ‘You will surely die;’ and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life, that wicked man will die in his iniquity; but I will require his blood at your hand.  [19] Yet if you warn the wicked, and he doesn’t turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he will die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.”\n     [20] “Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he will die. Because you have not given him warning, he will die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done will not be remembered; but I will require his blood at your hand.  [21] Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous not sin, and he does not sin, he will surely live, because he took warning; and you have delivered your soul.”\n     [22] Yahweh’s hand was there on me; and He said to me, “Arise, go out into the plain, and I will talk with you there.”\n     [23] Then I arose, and went out into the plain, and behold, Yahweh’s glory stood there, like the glory which I saw by the river Chebar. Then I fell on my face.\n     [24] Then the Spirit entered into me and set me on my feet. He spoke with me, and said to me, “Go, shut yourself inside your house.  [25] But you, son of man, behold, they will put ropes on you, and will bind you with them, and you will not go out among them.  [26] I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be mute and will not be able to correct them, for they are a rebellious house.  [27] But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall tell them, ‘This is what the Lord Yahweh says.’ He who hears, let Him hear; and He who refuses, let Him refuse; for they are a rebellious house.”\n"

My eye won’t spare, and I will have no pity.  [12] A third part of you will die with the pestilence, and they will be consumed with famine within you. A third part will fall by the sword around you. A third part I will scatter to all the winds, and will draw out a sword after them.\n     [13] “‘Thus my anger will be accomplished, and I will cause my wrath toward them to rest, and I will be comforted. They will know that I, Yahweh, have spoken in my zeal, when I have accomplished my wrath on them.\n     [14] “‘Moreover I will make you a desolation and a reproach among the nations that are around you, in the sight of all that pass by.

[3] He stretched out the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and the sky, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the gate of the inner court that looks toward the north, where there was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.  [4] Behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the appearance that I saw in the plain.\n     [5] Then he said to me, “Son of man, lift up your eyes now the way toward the north.”\n    So I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and saw, northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.\n     [6] He said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they do?

You will again see yet greater abominations than these.”\n     [16] He brought me into the inner court of Yahweh’s house; and I saw at the door of Yahweh’s temple, between the porch and the altar, there were about twenty-five men with their backs toward Yahweh’s temple and their faces toward the east. They were worshiping the sun toward the east.\n     [17] Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man?

When one builds up a wall, behold, they plaster it with whitewash.  [11] Tell those who plaster it with whitewash that it will fall. There will be an overflowing shower; and you, great hailstones, will fall. A stormy wind will tear it.  [12] Behold, when the wall has fallen, won’t it be said to you, “Where is the plaster with which you have plastered it?”\n     [13] “‘Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: “I will even tear it with a stormy wind in my wrath. There will be an overflowing shower in my anger, and great hailstones in wrath to consume it.  [14] So I will break down the wall that you have plastered with whitewash, and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be uncovered. It will fall, and you will be consumed in the middle of it. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.  [15] Thus I will accomplish my wrath on the wall, and on those who have plastered it with whitewash. I will tell you, ‘The wall is no more, nor those who plastered it—  [16] to wit, the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace,’” says the Lord Yahweh.’”\n     [17] You, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy against them,  [18] and say, “The Lord Yahweh says: ‘Woe to the women who sew magic bands on all elbows and make veils for the head of persons of every stature to hunt souls! Will you hunt the souls of my people and save souls alive for yourselves?  [19] You have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to kill the souls who should not die and to save the souls alive who should not live, by your lying to my people who listen to lies.’\n     [20] “Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I am against your magic bands, with which you hunt the souls to make them fly, and I will tear them from your arms. I will let the souls fly free, even the souls whom you ensnare like birds.  [21] I will also tear your veils and deliver my people out of your hand; and they will no longer be in your hand to be ensnared. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.  [22] Because with lies you have grieved the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, and be saved alive.  [23] Therefore you shall no more see false visions nor practice divination. I will deliver my people out of your hand. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.’”\n"

An Amorite was your father, and your mother was a Hittite.  [4] As for your birth, in the day you were born your navel was not cut. You weren’t washed in water to cleanse you. You weren’t salted at all, nor wrapped in blankets at all.  [5] No eye pitied you, to do any of these things to you, to have compassion on you; but you were cast out in the open field, because you were abhorred in the day that you were born.\n     [6] “‘“When I passed by you, and saw you wallowing in your blood, I said to you, ‘Though you are in your blood, live!’ Yes, I said to you, ‘Though you are in your blood, live!’  [7] I caused you to multiply as that which grows in the field, and you increased and grew great, and you attained to excellent beauty. Your breasts were formed, and your hair grew; yet you were naked and bare.\n     [8] “‘“Now when I passed by you, and looked at you, behold, your time was the time of love; and I spread my garment over you and covered your nakedness. Yes, I pledged myself to you and entered into a covenant with you,” says the Lord Yahweh, “and you became mine.\n     [9] “‘“Then I washed you with water. Yes, I thoroughly washed away your blood from you, and I anointed you with oil.  [10] I clothed you also with embroidered work and put leather sandals on you. I dressed you with fine linen and covered you with silk.  [11] I decked you with ornaments, put bracelets on your hands, and put a chain on your neck.  [12] I put a ring on your nose, earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head.  [13] Thus you were decked with gold and silver. Your clothing was of fine linen, silk, and embroidered work. You ate fine flour, honey, and oil. You were exceedingly beautiful, and you prospered to royal estate.  [14] Your renown went out among the nations for your beauty; for it was perfect, through my majesty which I had put on you,” says the Lord Yahweh.\n     [15] “‘“But you trusted in your beauty, and played the prostitute because of your renown, and poured out your prostitution on everyone who passed by. It was his.  [16] You took some of your garments, and made for yourselves high places decked with various colors, and played the prostitute on them. This shouldn’t happen, neither shall it be.  [17] You also took your beautiful jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself images of men, and played the prostitute with them.  [18] You took your embroidered garments, covered them, and set my oil and my incense before them.  [19] My bread also which I gave you, fine flour, oil, and honey, with which I fed you, you even set it before them for a pleasant aroma; and so it was,” says the Lord Yahweh.\n     [20] “‘“Moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters, whom you have borne to me, and you have sacrificed these to them to be devoured. Was your prostitution a small matter,  [21] that you have slain my children and delivered them up, in causing them to pass through the fire to them?  [22] In all your abominations and your prostitution you have not remembered the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, and were wallowing in your blood.\n     [23] “‘“It has happened after all your wickedness—woe, woe to you!” says the Lord Yahweh—  [24] “that you have built for yourselves a vaulted place, and have made yourselves a lofty place in every street.  [25] You have built your lofty place at the head of every way, and have made your beauty an abomination, and have opened your feet to everyone who passed by, and multiplied your prostitution.  [26] You have also committed sexual immorality with the Egyptians, your neighbors, great of flesh; and have multiplied your prostitution, to provoke me to anger.  [27] See therefore, I have stretched out my hand over you, and have diminished your portion, and delivered you to the will of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of your lewd way.  [28] You have played the prostitute also with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable; yes, you have played the prostitute with them, and yet you weren’t satisfied.  [29] You have moreover multiplied your prostitution to the land of merchants, to Chaldea; and yet you weren’t satisfied with this.\n     [30] “‘“How weak is your heart,” says the Lord Yahweh, “since you do all these things, the work of an impudent prostitute;  [31] in that you build your vaulted place at the head of every way, and make your lofty place in every street, and have not been as a prostitute, in that you scorn pay.\n     [32] “‘“Adulterous wife, who takes strangers instead of her husband!  [33] People give gifts to all prostitutes; but you give your gifts to all your lovers, and bribe them, that they may come to you on every side for your prostitution.  [34] You are different from other women in your prostitution, in that no one follows you to play the prostitute; and whereas you give hire, and no hire is given to you, therefore you are different.”’\n     [35] “Therefore, prostitute, hear Yahweh’s word:  [36] ‘The Lord Yahweh says, “Because your filthiness was poured out, and your nakedness uncovered through your prostitution with your lovers; and because of all the idols of your abominations, and for the blood of your children, that you gave to them;  [37] therefore see, I will gather all your lovers, with whom you have taken pleasure, and all those whom you have loved, with all those whom you have hated. I will even gather them against you on every side, and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness.  [38] I will judge you as women who break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will bring on you the blood of wrath and jealousy.  [39] I will also give you into their hand, and they will throw down your vaulted place, and break down your lofty places. They will strip you of your clothes and take your beautiful jewels. They will leave you naked and bare.  [40] They will also bring up a company against you, and they will stone you with stones, and thrust you through with their swords.  [41] They will burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women. I will cause you to cease from playing the prostitute, and you will also give no hire any more.  [42] So I will cause my wrath toward you to rest, and my jealousy will depart from you. I will be quiet, and will not be angry any more.\n     [43] “‘“Because you have not remembered the days of your youth, but have raged against me in all these things; therefore, behold, I also will bring your way on your head,” says the Lord Yahweh: “and you shall not commit this lewdness with all your abominations.\n     [44] “‘“Behold, everyone who uses proverbs will use this proverb against you, saying, ‘As is the mother, so is her daughter.’  [45] You are the daughter of your mother, who loathes her husband and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.  [46] Your elder sister is Samaria, who dwells at your left hand, she and her daughters; and your younger sister, who dwells at your right hand, is Sodom with her daughters.  [47] Yet you have not walked in their ways, nor done their abominations; but soon you were more corrupt than they in all your ways.  [48] As I live,” says the Lord Yahweh, “Sodom your sister has not done, she nor her daughters, as you have done, you and your daughters.\n     [49] “‘“Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: pride, fullness of bread, and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters. She also didn’t strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.  [50] They were arrogant and committed abomination before me. Therefore I took them away when I saw it.  [51] Samaria hasn’t committed half of your sins; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they, and have justified your sisters by all your abominations which you have done.  [52] You also bear your own shame yourself, in that you have given judgment for your sisters; through your sins that you have committed more abominable than they, they are more righteous than you. Yes, be also confounded, and bear your shame, in that you have justified your sisters.\n     [53] “‘“I will reverse their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and the captivity of your captives among them;  [54] that you may bear your own shame, and may be ashamed because of all that you have done, in that you are a comfort to them.  [55] Your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, will return to their former estate; and Samaria and her daughters will return to their former estate; and you and your daughters will return to your former estate.  [56] For your sister Sodom was not mentioned by your mouth in the day of your pride,  [57] before your wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all who are around her, the daughters of the Philistines, who despise you all around.  [58] You have borne your lewdness and your abominations,” says Yahweh.\n     [59] “‘For the Lord Yahweh says: “I will also deal with you as you have done, who have despised the oath in breaking the covenant.  [60] Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you.  [61] Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your sisters, your elder sisters and your younger; and I will give them to you for daughters, but not by your covenant.  [62] I will establish my covenant with you. Then you will know that I am Yahweh;  [63] that you may remember, and be confounded, and never open your mouth any more because of your shame, when I have forgiven you all that you have done,” says the Lord Yahweh.’”\n"

As I live,” says the Lord Yahweh, “I will not be inquired of by you.”’\n     [4] “Will you judge them, son of man? Will you judge them? Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers.  [5] Tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “In the day when I chose Israel, and swore to the offspring of the house of Jacob, and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt, when I swore to them, saying, ‘I am Yahweh your God;’  [6] in that day I swore to them to bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands.  [7] I said to them, ‘Each of you throw away the abominations of His eyes. Don’t defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am Yahweh your God.’\n     [8] “‘“But they rebelled against me and wouldn’t listen to me. They didn’t all throw away the abominations of their eyes. They also didn’t forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them, to accomplish my anger against them in the middle of the land of Egypt.  [9] But I worked for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations among which they were, in whose sight I made myself known to them in bringing them out of the land of Egypt.  [10] So I caused them to go out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.  [11] I gave them my statutes and showed them my ordinances, which if a man does, he will live in them.  [12] Moreover also I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies them.\n     [13] “‘“But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. They didn’t walk in my statutes and they rejected my ordinances, which if a man keeps, he shall live in them. They greatly profaned my Sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them in the wilderness, to consume them.  [14] But I worked for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out.  [15] Moreover also I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands,  [16] because they rejected my ordinances, and didn’t walk in my statutes, and profaned my Sabbaths; for their heart went after their idols.  [17] Nevertheless my eye spared them, and I didn’t destroy them. I didn’t make a full end of them in the wilderness.  [18] I said to their children in the wilderness, ‘Don’t walk in the statutes of your fathers. Don’t observe their ordinances or defile yourselves with their idols.  [19] I am Yahweh your God. Walk in my statutes, keep my ordinances, and do them.  [20] Make my Sabbaths holy. They shall be a sign between me and you, that you may know that I am Yahweh your God.’\n     [21] “‘“But the children rebelled against me.

[22] Nevertheless I withdrew my hand and worked for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out.  [23] Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them through the countries,  [24] because they had not executed my ordinances, but had rejected my statutes, and had profaned my Sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers’ idols.  [25] Moreover also I gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances in which they couldn’t live.  [26] I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused all that opens the womb to pass through the fire, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am Yahweh.”’\n     [27] “Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Moreover, in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.  [28] For when I had brought them into the land which I swore to give to them, then they saw every high hill and every thick tree, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering. There they also made their pleasant aroma, and there they poured out their drink offerings.  [29] Then I said to them, ‘What does the high place where you go mean?’ So its name is called Bamah to this day.”’\n     [30] “Therefore tell the house of Israel, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Do you pollute yourselves in the way of your fathers? Do you play the prostitute after their abominations?  [31] When you offer your gifts, when you make your sons pass through the fire, do you pollute yourselves with all your idols to this day? Should I be inquired of by you, house of Israel? As I live, says the Lord Yahweh, I will not be inquired of by you!\n     [32] “‘“That which comes into your mind will not be at all, in that you say, ‘We will be as the nations, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.’  [33] As I live,” says the Lord Yahweh, “surely with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out, I will be king over you.  [34] I will bring you out from the peoples, and will gather you out of the countries in which you are scattered with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out.  [35] I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will enter into judgment with you face to face.  [36] Just as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you,” says the Lord Yahweh.  [37] “I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant.  [38] I will purge out from among you the rebels and those who disobey me. I will bring them out of the land where they live, but they shall not enter into the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.”\n     [39] “‘As for you, house of Israel, the Lord Yahweh says: “Go, everyone serve His idols, and hereafter also, if you will not listen to me; but you shall no more profane my holy name with your gifts and with your idols.  [40] For in my holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel,” says the Lord Yahweh, “there all the house of Israel, all of them, shall serve me in the land. There I will accept them, and there I will require your offerings and the first fruits of your offerings, with all your holy things.  [41] I will accept you as a pleasant aroma when I bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries in which you have been scattered. I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations.  [42] You will know that I am Yahweh when I bring you into the land of Israel, into the country which I swore to give to your fathers.  [43] There you will remember your ways, and all your deeds in which you have polluted yourselves. Then you will loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that you have committed.  [44] You will know that I am Yahweh, when I have dealt with you for my name’s sake, not according to your evil ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, you house of Israel,” says the Lord Yahweh.’”\n     [45] Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,  [46] “Son of man, set your face toward the south, and preach toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the field in the south.  [47] Tell the forest of the south, ‘Hear Yahweh’s word: The Lord Yahweh says, “Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it will devour every green tree in you, and every dry tree. The burning flame will not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north will be burned by it.  [48] All flesh will see that I, Yahweh, have kindled it. It will not be quenched.”’”\n     [49] Then I said, “Ah Lord Yahweh! They say of me, ‘Isn’t He a speaker of parables?’”\n"

They played the prostitute in their youth. Their breasts were fondled there, and their youthful nipples were caressed there.  [4] Their names were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister. They became mine, and they bore sons and daughters. As for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah.\n     [5] “Oholah played the prostitute when she was mine. She doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbors,  [6] who were clothed with blue—governors and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses.  [7] She gave herself as a prostitute to them, all of them the choicest men of Assyria. She defiled herself with the idols of whoever she lusted after.  [8] She hasn’t left her prostitution since leaving Egypt; for in her youth they lay with her. They caressed her youthful nipples and they poured out their prostitution on her.\n     [9] “Therefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians on whom she doted.  [10] These uncovered her nakedness. They took her sons and her daughters, and they killed her with the sword. She became a byword among women; for they executed judgments on her.\n     [11] “Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet she was more corrupt in her lusting than she, and in her prostitution which was more depraved than the prostitution of her sister.  [12] She lusted after the Assyrians, governors and rulers—her neighbors, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men.  [13] I saw that she was defiled. They both went the same way.\n     [14] “She increased her prostitution; for she saw men portrayed on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with red,  [15] dressed with belts on their waists, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like princes, after the likeness of the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their birth.  [16] As soon as she saw them, she lusted after them and sent messengers to them into Chaldea.  [17] The Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their prostitution. She was polluted with them, and her soul was alienated from them.  [18] So she uncovered her prostitution and uncovered her nakedness. Then my soul was alienated from her, just like my soul was alienated from her sister.  [19] Yet she multiplied her prostitution, remembering the days of her youth, in which she had played the prostitute in the land of Egypt.  [20] She lusted after their lovers, whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.  [21] Thus you called to memory the lewdness of your youth, in the caressing of your nipples by the Egyptians because of your youthful breasts.\n     [22] “Therefore, Oholibah, the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I will raise up your lovers against you, from whom your soul is alienated, and I will bring them against you on every side:  [23] the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, Shoa, Koa, and all the Assyrians with them; all of them desirable young men, governors and rulers, princes and men of renown, all of them riding on horses.  [24] They will come against you with weapons, chariots, and wagons, and with a company of peoples. They will set themselves against you with buckler, shield, and helmet all around. I will commit the judgment to them, and they will judge you according to their judgments.  [25] I will set my jealousy against you, and they will deal with you in fury. They will take away your nose and your ears. Your remnant will fall by the sword. They will take your sons and your daughters; and the rest of you will be devoured by the fire.  [26] They will also strip you of your clothes and take away your beautiful jewels.  [27] Thus I will make your lewdness to cease from you, and remove your prostitution from the land of Egypt, so that you will not lift up your eyes to them, nor remember Egypt any more.’\n     [28] “For the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I will deliver you into the hand of them whom you hate, into the hand of them from whom your soul is alienated.  [29] They will deal with you in hatred, and will take away all your labor, and will leave you naked and bare. The nakedness of your prostitution will be uncovered, both your lewdness and your prostitution.  [30] These things will be done to you because you have played the prostitute after the nations, and because you are polluted with their idols.  [31] You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore I will give her cup into your hand.’\n     [32] “The Lord Yahweh says:\n  ‘You will drink of your sister’s cup,\n    which is deep and large.\n  You will be ridiculed and held in derision.\n    It contains much.\n   [33] You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow,\n    with the cup of astonishment and desolation,\n    with the cup of your sister Samaria.\n   [34] You will even drink it and drain it out.\n    You will gnaw the broken pieces of it,\n    and will tear your breasts;\nfor I have spoken it,’ says the Lord Yahweh.\n     [35] “Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Because you have forgotten me and cast me behind your back, therefore you also bear your lewdness and your prostitution.’”\n     [36] Yahweh said moreover to me: “Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their abominations.  [37] For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands. They have committed adultery with their idols. They have also caused their sons, whom they bore to me, to pass through the fire to them to be devoured.  [38] Moreover this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my Sabbaths.  [39] For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and behold, they have done this in the middle of my house.\n     [40] “Furthermore you sisters have sent for men who come from far away, to whom a messenger was sent, and behold, they came; for whom you washed yourself, painted your eyes, decorated yourself with ornaments,  [41] and sat on a stately bed, with a table prepared before it, whereupon you set my incense and my oil.\n     [42] “The voice of a multitude being at ease was with her. With men of the common sort were brought drunkards from the wilderness; and they put bracelets on their hands, and beautiful crowns on their heads.  [43] Then I said of her who was old in adulteries, ‘Now they will play the prostitute with her, and she with them.’  [44] They went in to her, as they go in to a prostitute. So they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the lewd women.  [45] Righteous men will judge them with the judgment of adulteresses and with the judgment of women who shed blood, because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.\n     [46] “For the Lord Yahweh says: ‘I will bring up a mob against them, and will give them to be tossed back and forth and robbed.  [47] The company will stone them with stones and dispatch them with their swords. They will kill their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.\n     [48] “‘Thus I will cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to be lewd like you.  [49] They will recompense your lewdness on you, and you will bear the sins of your idols. Then you will know that I am the Lord Yahweh.’”\n"

[3] Utter a parable to the rebellious house, and tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says,\n  “Put the cauldron on the fire.\n    Put it on,\n    and also pour water into it.\n   [4] Gather its pieces into it,\n    even every good piece:\n    the thigh and the shoulder.\n    Fill it with the choice bones.\n   [5] Take the choice of the flock,\n    and also a pile of wood for the bones under the cauldron.\n  Make it boil well.\n    Yes, let its bones be boiled within it.”\n [6] “‘Therefore the Lord Yahweh says:\n  “Woe to the bloody city,\n    to the cauldron whose rust is in it,\n    and whose rust hasn’t gone out of it!\n  Take out of it piece after piece\n    without casting lots for it.\n    \n   [7] “‘“For the blood she shed is in the middle of her.\n    She set it on the bare rock.\n  She didn’t pour it on the ground,\n    to cover it with dust.\n   [8] That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance,\n    I have set her blood on the bare rock,\n    that it should not be covered.”\n [9] “‘Therefore the Lord Yahweh says:\n  “Woe to the bloody city!\n    I also will make the pile great.\n   [10] Heap on the wood.\n    Make the fire hot.\n  Boil the meat well.\n    Make the broth thick,\n    and let the bones be burned.\n   [11] Then set it empty on its coals,\n    that it may be hot,\n  and its bronze may burn,\n    and that its filthiness may be molten in it,\n    that its rust may be consumed.\n   [12] She is weary with toil;\n    yet her great rust,\n    rust by fire, doesn’t leave her.\n     [13] “‘“In your filthiness is lewdness. Because I have cleansed you and you weren’t cleansed, you won’t be cleansed from your filthiness any more, until I have caused my wrath toward you to rest.\n     [14] “‘“I, Yahweh, have spoken it. It will happen, and I will do it. I won’t go back. I won’t spare. I won’t repent. According to your ways and according to your doings, they will judge you,” says the Lord Yahweh.’”\n     [15] Also Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,  [16] “Son of man, behold, I will take away from you the desire of your eyes with one stroke; yet you shall neither mourn nor weep, neither shall your tears run down.  [17] Sigh, but not aloud. Make no mourning for the dead. Bind your headdress on you, and put your sandals on your feet. Don’t cover your lips, and don’t eat mourner’s bread.”\n     [18] So I spoke to the people in the morning, and at evening my wife died. So I did in the morning as I was commanded.\n     [19] The people asked me, “Won’t you tell us what these things mean to us, that you act like this?”\n     [20] Then I said to them, “Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,  [21] ‘Speak to the house of Israel, “The Lord Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pities; and your sons and your daughters whom you have left behind will fall by the sword.  [22] You will do as I have done. You won’t cover your lips or eat mourner’s bread.  [23] Your turbans will be on your heads, and your sandals on your feet. You won’t mourn or weep; but you will pine away in your iniquities, and moan one toward another.  [24] Thus Ezekiel will be a sign to you; according to all that He has done, you will do. When this comes, then you will know that I am the Lord Yahweh.’”’”\n     [25] “You, son of man, shouldn’t it be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their heart—their sons and their daughters—  [26] that in that day he who escapes will come to you, to cause you to hear it with your ears?  [27] In that day your mouth will be opened to Him who has escaped, and you will speak and be no more mute. So you will be a sign to them. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.”\n"

[6] But if the watchman sees the sword come and doesn’t blow the trumpet, and the people aren’t warned, and the sword comes and takes any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at the watchman’s hand.’\n     [7] “So you, son of man, I have set you a watchman to the house of Israel. Therefore hear the word from my mouth, and give them warnings from me.  [8] When I tell the wicked, ‘O wicked man, you will surely die,’ and you don’t speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man will die in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at your hand.  [9] Nevertheless, if you warn the wicked of his way to turn from it, and he doesn’t turn from his way; he will die in his iniquity, but you have delivered your soul.\n     [10] “You, son of man, tell the house of Israel: ‘You say this, “Our transgressions and our sins are on us, and we pine away in them. How then can we live?”’  [11] Tell them, ‘“As I live,” says the Lord Yahweh, “I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from His way and live. Turn, turn from your evil ways! For why will you die, house of Israel?”’\n     [12] “You, son of man, tell the children of your people, ‘The righteousness of the righteous will not deliver him in the day of his disobedience. And as for the wickedness of the wicked, he will not fall by it in the day that he turns from his wickedness; neither will he who is righteous be able to live by it in the day that he sins.  [13] When I tell the righteous that he will surely live, if he trusts in his righteousness and commits iniquity, none of his righteous deeds will be remembered; but he will die in his iniquity that he has committed.  [14] Again, when I say to the wicked, “You will surely die,” if he turns from his sin and does that which is lawful and right,  [15] if the wicked restore the pledge, give again that which he had taken by robbery, walk in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity, he will surely live. He will not die.  [16] None of his sins that he has committed will be remembered against him. He has done that which is lawful and right. He will surely live.\n     [17] “‘Yet the children of your people say, “The way of the Lord is not fair;” but as for them, their way is not fair.  [18] When the righteous turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, he will even die therein.  [19] When the wicked turns from his wickedness and does that which is lawful and right, he will live by it.

The land is given us for inheritance.’  [25] Therefore tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “You eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes to your idols, and shed blood. So should you possess the land?  [26] You stand on your sword, you work abomination, and every one of you defiles his neighbor’s wife. So should you possess the land?”’\n     [27] “You shall tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “As I live, surely those who are in the waste places will fall by the sword. I will give whoever is in the open field to the animals to be devoured, and those who are in the strongholds and in the caves will die of the pestilence.

[29] Then they will know that I am Yahweh, when I have made the land a desolation and an astonishment because of all their abominations which they have committed.”’\n     [30] “As for you, son of man, the children of your people talk about you by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak to one another, everyone to His brother, saying, ‘Please come and hear what the word is that comes out from Yahweh.’  [31] They come to you as the people come, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear your words, but don’t do them; for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goes after their gain.

Yes, my sheep were scattered on all the surface of the earth. There was no one who searched or sought.”\n     [7] “‘Therefore, you shepherds, hear Yahweh’s word:  [8] “As I live,” says the Lord Yahweh, “surely because my sheep became a prey, and my sheep became food to all the animals of the field, because there was no shepherd, and my shepherds didn’t search for my sheep, but the shepherds fed themselves, and didn’t feed my sheep,  [9] therefore, you shepherds, hear Yahweh’s word!”  [10] The Lord Yahweh says: “Behold, I am against the shepherds. I will require my sheep at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the sheep. The shepherds won’t feed themselves any more.

I will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.  [13] I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land. I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited places of the country.  [14] I will feed them with good pasture, and their fold will be on the mountains of the height of Israel. There they will lie down in a good fold. They will feed on rich pasture on the mountains of Israel.  [15] I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will cause them to lie down,” says the Lord Yahweh.

I will feed them in justice.”’\n     [17] “As for you, O my flock, the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, the rams and the male goats.  [18] Does it seem a small thing to you to have fed on the good pasture, but you must tread down with your feet the residue of your pasture? And to have drunk of the clear waters, but must you foul the residue with your feet?  [19] As for my sheep, they eat that which you have trodden with your feet, and they drink that which you have fouled with your feet.’\n     [20] “Therefore the Lord Yahweh says to them: ‘Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.  [21] Because you thrust with side and with shoulder, and push all the diseased with your horns, until you have scattered them abroad,  [22] therefore I will save my flock, and they will no more be a prey.

[2] The Lord Yahweh says: ‘Because the enemy has said against you, “Aha!” and, “The ancient high places are ours in possession!”’  [3] therefore prophesy, and say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Because, even because they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that you might be a possession to the residue of the nations, and you are taken up in the lips of talkers, and the evil report of the people;”  [4] therefore, you mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Yahweh: The Lord Yahweh says to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken, which have become a prey and derision to the residue of the nations that are all around;  [5] therefore the Lord Yahweh says: “Surely in the fire of my jealousy I have spoken against the residue of the nations, and against all Edom, that have appointed my land to themselves for a possession with the joy of all their heart, with despite of soul, to cast it out for a prey.”’  [6] Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and tell the mountains, the hills, the watercourses and the valleys, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my wrath, because you have borne the shame of the nations.”  [7] Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: “I have sworn, ‘Surely the nations that are around you will bear their shame.’\n     [8] “‘“But you, mountains of Israel, you shall shoot out your branches and yield your fruit to my people Israel; for they are at hand to come.  [9] For, behold, I am for you, and I will come to you, and you will be tilled and sown.  [10] I will multiply men on you, all the house of Israel, even all of it. The cities will be inhabited and the waste places will be built.  [11] I will multiply man and animal on you. They will increase and be fruitful. I will cause you to be inhabited as you were before, and you will do better than at your beginnings. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.  [12] Yes, I will cause men to walk on you, even my people Israel. They will possess you, and you will be their inheritance, and you will never again bereave them of their children.”\n     [13] “‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Because they say to you, ‘You are a devourer of men, and have been a bereaver of your nation;’  [14] therefore you shall devour men no more, and not bereave your nation any more,” says the Lord Yahweh.  [15] “I won’t let you hear the shame of the nations any more. You won’t bear the reproach of the peoples any more, and you won’t cause your nation to stumble any more,” says the Lord Yahweh.’”\n     [16] Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,  [17] “Son of man, when the house of Israel lived in their own land, they defiled it by their ways and by their deeds. Their way before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity.  [18] Therefore I poured out my wrath on them for the blood which they had poured out on the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols.  [19] I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries. I judged them according to their way and according to their deeds.  [20] When they came to the nations where they went, they profaned my holy name, in that men said of them, ‘These are Yahweh’s people, and have left His land.’  [21] But I had respect for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations where they went.\n     [22] “Therefore tell the house of Israel, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “I don’t do this for your sake, house of Israel, but for my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations where you went.  [23] I will sanctify my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned among them. Then the nations will know that I am Yahweh,” says the Lord Yahweh, “when I am proven holy in you before their eyes.\n     [24] “‘“For I will take you from among the nations and gather you out of all the countries, and will bring you into your own land.  [25] I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols.  [26] I will also give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit within you. I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.  [27] I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes. You will keep my ordinances and do them.  [28] You will dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers. You will be my people, and I will be your God.  [29] I will save you from all your uncleanness. I will call for the grain and will multiply it, and lay no famine on you.  [30] I will multiply the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field, that you may receive no more the reproach of famine among the nations.\n     [31] “‘“Then you will remember your evil ways, and your deeds that were not good; and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.  [32] I don’t do this for your sake,” says the Lord Yahweh. “Let it be known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your ways, house of Israel.”\n     [33] “‘The Lord Yahweh says: “In the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited and the waste places will be built.  [34] The land that was desolate will be tilled instead of being a desolation in the sight of all who passed by.  [35] They will say, ‘This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden. The waste, desolate, and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited.’  [36] Then the nations that are left around you will know that I, Yahweh, have built the ruined places and planted that which was desolate. I, Yahweh, have spoken it, and I will do it.”\n     [37] “‘The Lord Yahweh says: “For this, moreover, I will be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them: I will increase them with men like a flock.  [38] As the flock for sacrifice, as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed feasts, so the waste cities will be filled with flocks of men. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.’”\n"

[3] He said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?”\n    I answered, “Lord Yahweh, you know.”\n     [4] Again He said to me, “Prophesy over these bones, and tell them, ‘You dry bones, hear Yahweh’s word.

[6] I will lay sinews on you, and will bring up flesh on you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you will live. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.”’”\n     [7] So I prophesied as I was commanded. As I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold, there was an earthquake. Then the bones came together, bone to its bone.  [8] I saw, and, behold, there were sinews on them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them.\n     [9] Then He said to me, “Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, son of man, and tell the wind, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Come from the four winds, breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.”’”\n     [10] So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up on their feet, an exceedingly great army.\n     [11] Then he said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, ‘Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost. We are completely cut off.’  [12] Therefore prophesy, and tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, my people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.

They won’t be divided into two kingdoms any more at all.  [23] They won’t defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling places in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them. So they will be my people, and I will be their God.\n     [24] “‘“My servant David will be king over them. They all will have one shepherd.

They will dwell therein, they, and their children, and their children’s children, forever. David my servant will be their prince forever.  [26] Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them. It will be an everlasting covenant with them. I will place them, multiply them, and will set my sanctuary among them forever more.  [27] My tent also will be with them. I will be their God, and they will be my people.  [28] The nations will know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies Israel, when my sanctuary is among them forever more.”’”\n"

[2] In the visions of God He brought me into the land of Israel, and set me down on a very high mountain, on which was something like the frame of a city to the south.  [3] He brought me there; and, behold, there was a man whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze, with a line of flax in his hand and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.  [4] The man said to me, “Son of man, see with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and set your heart on all that I will show you; for you have been brought here so that I may show them to you. Declare all that you see to the house of Israel.”\n     [5] Behold, there was a wall on the outside of the house all around, and in the man’s hand a measuring reed six cubits long, of a cubit and a hand width each. So he measured the thickness of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.\n     [6] Then he came to the gate which looks toward the east, and went up its steps. He measured the threshold of the gate, one reed wide; and the other threshold, one reed wide.  [7] Every lodge was one reed long and one reed wide. Between the lodges was five cubits. The threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed.\n     [8] He measured also the porch of the gate toward the house, one reed.  [9] Then he measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and its posts, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was toward the house.\n     [10] The side rooms of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side. The three of them were of one measure. The posts had one measure on this side and on that side.  [11] He measured the width of the opening of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits;  [12] and a border before the lodges, one cubit on this side, and a border, one cubit on that side; and the side rooms, six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.  [13] He measured the gate from the roof of the one side room to the roof of the other, a width of twenty-five cubits, door against door.  [14] He also made posts, sixty cubits; and the court reached to the posts, around the gate.  [15] From the forefront of the gate at the entrance to the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits.  [16] There were closed windows to the side rooms, and to their posts within the gate all around, and likewise to the arches. Windows were around inward. Palm trees were on each post.\n     [17] Then he brought me into the outer court. Behold, there were rooms and a pavement made for the court all around. Thirty rooms were on the pavement.  [18] The pavement was by the side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates, even the lower pavement.  [19] Then he measured the width from the forefront of the lower gate to the forefront of the inner court outside, one hundred cubits, both on the east and on the north.\n     [20] He measured the length and width of the gate of the outer court which faces toward the north.  [21] The lodges of it were three on this side and three on that side. Its posts and its arches were the same as the measure of the first gate: its length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.  [22] Its windows, its arches, and its palm trees were the same as the measure of the gate which faces toward the east. They went up to it by seven steps. Its arches were before them.  [23] There was a gate to the inner court facing the other gate, on the north and on the east. He measured one hundred cubits from gate to gate.\n     [24] He led me toward the south; and behold, there was a gate toward the south. He measured its posts and its arches according to these measurements.  [25] There were windows in it and in its arches all around, like the other windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.  [26] There were seven steps to go up to it, and its arches were before them. It had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, on its posts.  [27] There was a gate to the inner court toward the south. He measured one hundred cubits from gate to gate toward the south.\n     [28] Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate. He measured the south gate according to these measurements;  [29] with its lodges, its posts, and its arches, according to these measurements. There were windows in it and in its arches all around. It was fifty cubits long, and twenty-five cubits wide.  [30] There were arches all around, twenty-five cubits long and five cubits wide.  [31] Its arches were toward the outer court. Palm trees were on its posts. The ascent to it had eight steps.\n     [32] He brought me into the inner court toward the east. He measured the gate according to these measurements;  [33] with its lodges, its posts, and its arches, according to these measurements. There were windows in it and in its arches all around. It was fifty cubits long, and twenty-five cubits wide.  [34] Its arches were toward the outer court. Palm trees were on its posts on this side and on that side. The ascent to it had eight steps.\n     [35] He brought me to the north gate, and he measured it according to these measurements—  [36] its lodges, its posts, and its arches. There were windows in it all around. The length was fifty cubits and the width twenty-five cubits.  [37] Its posts were toward the outer court. Palm trees were on its posts on this side and on that side. The ascent to it had eight steps.\n     [38] A room with its door was by the posts at the gates. They washed the burnt offering there.  [39] In the porch of the gate were two tables on this side and two tables on that side, on which to kill the burnt offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering.  [40] On the one side outside, as one goes up to the entry of the gate toward the north, were two tables; and on the other side, which belonged to the porch of the gate, were two tables.  [41] Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate: eight tables, on which they killed the sacrifices.  [42] There were four cut stone tables for the burnt offering, a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high. They laid the instruments with which they killed the burnt offering and the sacrifice on them.  [43] The hooks, a hand width long, were fastened within all around. The meat of the offering was on the tables.\n     [44] Outside of the inner gate were rooms for the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate. They faced toward the south. One at the side of the east gate faced toward the north.  [45] He said to me, “This room, which faces toward the south, is for the priests who perform the duty of the house.  [46] The room which faces toward the north is for the priests who perform the duty of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who from among the sons of Levi come near to Yahweh to minister to Him.”  [47] He measured the court, one hundred cubits long and one hundred cubits wide, square. The altar was before the house.\n     [48] Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side. The width of the gate was three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side.  [49] The length of the porch was twenty cubits and the width eleven cubits, even by the steps by which they went up to it. There were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.\n"

[7] The side rooms were wider on the higher levels, because the walls were narrower at the higher levels. Therefore the width of the house increased upward; and so one went up from the lowest level to the highest through the middle level.\n     [8] I saw also that the house had a raised base all around. The foundations of the side rooms were a full reed of six great cubits.  [9] The thickness of the outer wall of the side rooms was five cubits. That which was left was the place of the side rooms that belonged to the house.  [10] Between the rooms was a width of twenty cubits around the house on every side.  [11] The doors of the side rooms were toward an open area that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south. The width of the open area was five cubits all around.\n     [12] The building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits wide; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits.\n     [13] So he measured the temple, one hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with its walls, one hundred cubits long;  [14] also the width of the face of the temple, and of the separate place toward the east, one hundred cubits.\n     [15] He measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at its back, and its galleries on the one side and on the other side, one hundred cubits from the inner temple, and the porches of the court,  [16] the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries around on their three stories, opposite the threshold, with wood ceilings all around, and from the ground up to the windows, (now the windows were covered),  [17] to the space above the door, even to the inner house, and outside, and by all the wall all around inside and outside, by measure.  [18] It was made with cherubim and palm trees. A palm tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces,  [19] so that there was the face of a man toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side. It was made like this through all the house all around.  [20] Cherubim and palm trees were made from the ground to above the door. The wall of the temple was like this.\n     [21] The door posts of the nave were squared. As for the face of the nave, its appearance was as the appearance of the temple.  [22] The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and its length two cubits. Its corners, its base, and its walls were of wood. He said to me, “This is the table that is before Yahweh.”  [23] The temple and the sanctuary had two doors.  [24] The doors had two leaves each, two turning leaves: two for the one door, and two leaves for the other.  [25] There were made on them, on the doors of the nave, cherubim and palm trees, like those made on the walls. There was a threshold of wood on the face of the porch outside.  [26] There were closed windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch. This is how the side rooms of the temple and the thresholds were arranged.\n"

Then he brought me into the room that was opposite the separate place, and which was opposite the building toward the north.  [2] Facing the length of one hundred cubits was the north door, and the width was fifty cubits.  [3] Opposite the twenty cubits which belonged to the inner court, and opposite the pavement which belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery in the three stories.  [4] Before the rooms was a walk of ten cubits’ width inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors were toward the north.  [5] Now the upper rooms were shorter; for the galleries took away from these more than from the lower and the middle in the building.  [6] For they were in three stories, and they didn’t have pillars as the pillars of the courts. Therefore the uppermost was set back more than the lowest and the middle from the ground.  [7] The wall that was outside by the side of the rooms, toward the outer court before the rooms, was fifty cubits long.  [8] For the length of the rooms that were in the outer court was fifty cubits. Behold, those facing the temple were one hundred cubits.  [9] From under these rooms was the entry on the east side, as one goes into them from the outer court.\n     [10] In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, before the separate place, and before the building, there were rooms.  [11] The way before them was like the appearance of the rooms which were toward the north. Their length and width were the same. All their exits had the same arrangement and doors.  [12] Like the doors of the rooms that were toward the south was a door at the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one enters into them.\n     [13] Then He said to me, “The north rooms and the south rooms, which are opposite the separate place, are the holy rooms, where the priests who are near to Yahweh shall eat the most holy things. There they shall lay the most holy things, with the meal offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.  [14] When the priests enter in, then they shall not go out of the holy place into the outer court until they lay their garments in which they minister there; for they are holy. Then they shall put on other garments, and shall approach that which is for the people.”\n     [15] Now when he had finished measuring the inner house, he brought me out by the way of the gate which faces toward the east, and measured it all around.  [16] He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed all around.  [17] He measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed all around.  [18] He measured on the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.  [19] He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.  [20] He measured it on the four sides. It had a wall around it, the length five hundred cubits, and the width five hundred cubits, to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common.\n"

Then they shall be to you as the native-born among the children of Israel. They shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.  [23] In whatever tribe the stranger lives, there you shall give Him His inheritance,” says the Lord Yahweh.\n"

[2] The Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into His hand, with some of the vessels of the house of God; and He carried them into the land of Shinar to the house of His god. He brought the vessels into the treasure house of His god.\n     [3] The king spoke to Ashpenaz, the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring in some of the children of Israel, even of the royal offspring and of the nobles:  [4] youths in whom was no defect, but well-favored, skillful in all wisdom, endowed with knowledge, understanding science, and who had the ability to stand in the king’s palace; and that he should teach them the learning and the language of the Chaldeans.  [5] The king appointed for them a daily portion of the king’s delicacies and of the wine which he drank, and that they should be nourished three years, that at its end they should stand before the king.\n     [6] Now among these of the children of Judah were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.  [7] The prince of the eunuchs gave names to them: to Daniel he gave the name Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abednego.\n     [8] But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king’s delicacies, nor with the wine which he drank. Therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.  [9] Now God made Daniel find kindness and compassion in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs.  [10] The prince of the eunuchs said to Daniel, “I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your food and your drink. For why should he see your faces worse looking than the youths who are of your own age? Then you would endanger my head with the king.”\n     [11] Then Daniel said to the steward whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:  [12] “Test your servants, I beg you, ten days; and let them give us vegetables to eat and water to drink.  [13] Then let our faces be examined before you, and the face of the youths who eat of the king’s delicacies; and as you see, deal with your servants.”  [14] So he listened to them in this matter, and tested them for ten days.\n     [15] At the end of ten days, their faces appeared fairer and they were fatter in flesh than all the youths who ate of the king’s delicacies.  [16] So the steward took away their delicacies and the wine that they were given to drink, and gave them vegetables.\n     [17] Now as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.\n     [18] At the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in, the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.  [19] The king talked with them; and among them all was found no one like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. Therefore stood they before the king.  [20] In every matter of wisdom and understanding concerning which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters who were in all his realm.\n     [21] Daniel continued even to the first year of King Cyrus.\n"

          "content": "     [1] In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams; and his spirit was troubled, and his sleep went from him.  [2] Then the king commanded that the magicians, the enchanters, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans be called to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king.  [3] The king said to them, “I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.”\n     [4] Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in the Syrian language, “O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.”\n     [5] The king answered the Chaldeans, “The thing has gone from me. If you don’t make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you will be cut in pieces, and your houses will be made a dunghill.  [6] But if you show the dream and its interpretation, you will receive from me gifts, rewards, and great honor. Therefore show me the dream and its interpretation.”\n     [7] They answered the second time and said, “Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.”\n     [8] The king answered, “I know of a certainty that you are trying to gain time, because you see the thing has gone from me.  [9] But if you don’t make known to me the dream, there is but one law for you; for you have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, until the situation changes. Therefore tell me the dream, and I will know that you can show me its interpretation.”\n     [10] The Chaldeans answered the king and said, “There is not a man on the earth who can show the king’s matter, because no king, lord, or ruler has asked such a thing of any magician, enchanter, or Chaldean.  [11] It is a rare thing that the king requires, and there is no other who can show it before the king except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.”\n     [12] Because of this, the king was angry and very furious, and commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be destroyed.  [13] So the decree went out, and the wise men were to be slain. They sought Daniel and his companions to be slain.\n     [14] Then Daniel returned answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the king’s guard, who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon.  [15] He answered Arioch the king’s captain, “Why is the decree so urgent from the king?” Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.  [16] Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time, and he would show the king the interpretation.\n     [17] Then Daniel went to his house and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:  [18] that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret, that Daniel and His companions would not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.  [19] Then the secret was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.  [20] Daniel answered,\n  “Blessed be the name of God forever and ever;\n    for wisdom and might are His.\n   [21] He changes the times and the seasons.\n    He removes kings and sets up kings.\n  He gives wisdom to the wise,\n    and knowledge to those who have understanding.\n   [22] He reveals the deep and secret things.\n    He knows what is in the darkness,\n    and the light dwells with him.\n   [23] I thank you and praise you,\n    O God of my fathers,\n  who have given me wisdom and might,\n    and have now made known to me what we desired of you;\n    for you have made known to us the king’s matter.”\n     [24] Therefore Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He went and said this to him: “Don’t destroy the wise men of Babylon. Bring me in before the king, and I will show to the king the interpretation.”\n     [25] Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said this to him: “I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judah who will make known to the king the interpretation.”\n     [26] The king answered Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, “Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and its interpretation?”\n     [27] Daniel answered before the king, and said, “The secret which the king has demanded can’t be shown to the king by wise men, enchanters, magicians, or soothsayers;  [28] but there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will be in the latter days. Your dream and the visions of your head on your bed are these:\n     [29] “As for you, O king, your thoughts came on your bed, what should happen hereafter; and he who reveals secrets has made known to you what will happen.  [30] But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that you may know the thoughts of your heart.\n     [31] “You, O king, saw, and behold, a great image. This image, which was mighty, and whose brightness was excellent, stood before you; and its appearance was terrifying.  [32] As for this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze,  [33] its legs of iron, its feet part of iron and part of clay.  [34] You saw until a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image on its feet that were of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces.  [35] Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors. The wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them. The stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.\n     [36] “This is the dream; and we will tell its interpretation before the king.  [37] You, O king, are king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, the strength, and the glory.  [38] Wherever the children of men dwell, he has given the animals of the field and the birds of the sky into your hand, and has made you rule over them all. You are the head of gold.\n     [39] “After you, another kingdom will arise that is inferior to you; and another third kingdom of bronze, which will rule over all the earth.  [40] The fourth kingdom will be strong as iron, because iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things; and as iron that crushes all these, it will break in pieces and crush.  [41] Whereas you saw the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay and part of iron, it will be a divided kingdom; but there will be in it of the strength of the iron, because you saw the iron mixed with miry clay.  [42] As the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle.  [43] Whereas you saw the iron mixed with miry clay, they will mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they won’t cling to one another, even as iron does not mix with clay.\n     [44] “In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which will never be destroyed, nor will its sovereignty be left to another people; but it will break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it will stand forever.  [45] Because you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold, the great God has made known to the king what will happen hereafter. The dream is certain, and its interpretation sure.”\n     [46] Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, worshiped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an offering and sweet odors to him.  [47] The king answered to Daniel, and said, “Of a truth your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, since you have been able to reveal this secret.”\n     [48] Then the king made Daniel great and gave him many great gifts, and made him rule over the whole province of Babylon and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon.  [49] Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon, but Daniel was in the king’s gate.\n"

          "content": "     [1] Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits and its width six cubits. He set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.  [2] Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the local governors, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.  [3] Then the local governors, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces were gathered together to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.\n     [4] Then the herald cried aloud, “To you it is commanded, peoples, nations, and languages,  [5] that whenever you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music, you fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up.  [6] Whoever doesn’t fall down and worship shall be cast into the middle of a burning fiery furnace the same hour.”\n     [7] Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.\n     [8] Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near and brought accusation against the Jews.  [9] They answered Nebuchadnezzar the king, “O king, live for ever!  [10] You, O king, have made a decree that every man who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music shall fall down and worship the golden image;  [11] and whoever doesn’t fall down and worship shall be cast into the middle of a burning fiery furnace.  [12] There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men, O king, have not respected you. They don’t serve your gods, and don’t worship the golden image which you have set up.”\n     [13] Then Nebuchadnezzar in rage and fury commanded that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be brought. Then these men were brought before the king.  [14] Nebuchadnezzar answered them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you don’t serve my gods and you don’t worship the golden image which I have set up?  [15] Now if you are ready whenever you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music to fall down and worship the image which I have made, good; but if you don’t worship, you shall be cast the same hour into the middle of a burning fiery furnace. Who is that god who will deliver you out of my hands?”\n     [16] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered the king, “Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.  [17] If it happens, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and He will deliver us out of your hand, O king.  [18] But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up.”\n     [19] Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury, and the form of his appearance was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated.  [20] He commanded certain mighty men who were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.  [21] Then these men were bound in their pants, their tunics, and their mantles, and their other clothes, and were cast into the middle of the burning fiery furnace.  [22] Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent and the furnace exceedingly hot, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.  [23] These three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the middle of the burning fiery furnace.\n     [24] Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished and rose up in haste. He spoke and said to his counselors, “Didn’t we cast three men bound into the middle of the fire?”\n    They answered the king, “True, O king.”\n     [25] He answered, “Look, I see four men loose, walking in the middle of the fire, and they are unharmed. The appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods.”\n     [26] Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace. He spoke and said, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, you servants of the Most High God, come out, and come here!”\n    Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the middle of the fire.  [27] The local governors, the deputies, and the governors, and the king’s counselors, being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power on their bodies. The hair of their head wasn’t singed. Their pants weren’t changed. The smell of fire wasn’t even on them.\n     [28] Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent His angel and delivered His servants who trusted in Him, and have changed the king’s word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own God.  [29] Therefore I make a decree that every people, nation, and language which speak anything evil against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill, because there is no other god who is able to deliver like this.”\n     [30] Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.\n"

[5] I saw a dream which made me afraid; and the thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.  [6] Therefore I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.  [7] Then the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers came in; and I told them the dream, but they didn’t make known to me its interpretation.  [8] But at last, Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods. I told the dream before Him, saying,\n     [9] “Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and no secret troubles you, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and its interpretation.  [10] These were the visions of my head on my bed: I saw, and behold, a tree in the middle of the earth; and its height was great.  [11] The tree grew and was strong. Its height reached to the sky and its sight to the end of all the earth.  [12] Its leaves were beautiful, and it had much fruit, and in it was food for all. The animals of the field had shade under it, and the birds of the sky lived in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it.\n     [13] “I saw in the visions of my head on my bed, and behold, a holy watcher came down from the sky.  [14] He cried aloud and said this: ‘Cut down the tree, and cut off its branches! Shake off its leaves and scatter its fruit! Let the animals get away from under it and the birds from its branches.  [15] Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of the sky. Let his portion be with the animals in the grass of the earth.  [16] Let his heart be changed from man’s, and let an animal’s heart be given to him. Then let seven times pass over him.\n     [17] “‘The sentence is by the decree of the watchers and the demand by the word of the holy ones, to the intent that the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will, and sets up over it the lowest of men.’\n     [18] “This dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have seen; and you, Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, because all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation; but you are able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in you.”\n     [19] Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was stricken mute for a while, and his thoughts troubled him. The king answered, “Belteshazzar, don’t let the dream or the interpretation, trouble you.”\n    Belteshazzar answered, “My lord, may the dream be for those who hate you, and its interpretation to your adversaries.  [20] The tree that you saw, which grew and was strong, whose height reached to the sky and its sight to all the earth;  [21] whose leaves were beautiful and its fruit plentiful, and in it was food for all; under which the animals of the field lived, and on whose branches the birds of the sky had their habitation—  [22] it is you, O king, that have grown and become strong; for your greatness has grown, and reaches to the sky, and your dominion to the end of the earth.\n     [23] “Whereas the king saw a holy watcher coming down from the sky and saying, ‘Cut down the tree, and destroy it; nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field, and let it be wet with the dew of the sky. Let his portion be with the animals of the field, until seven times pass over him.’\n     [24] “This is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which has come on my lord the king:  [25] You will be driven from men and your dwelling shall be with the animals of the field. You will be made to eat grass as oxen, and will be wet with the dew of the sky, and seven times shall pass over you, until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will.  [26] Whereas it was commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree, your kingdom shall be sure to you after you know that Heavens rules.  [27] Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you, and break off your sins by righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor. Perhaps there may be a lengthening of your tranquility.”\n     [28] All this came on the King Nebuchadnezzar.  [29] At the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon.  [30] The king spoke and said, “Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for the royal dwelling place by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?”\n     [31] While the word was in the king’s mouth, a voice came from the sky, saying, “O King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: ‘The kingdom has departed from you.  [32] You shall be driven from men, and your dwelling shall be with the animals of the field. You shall be made to eat grass like oxen. Seven times shall pass over you, until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will.’”\n     [33] This was fulfilled the same hour on Nebuchadnezzar. He was driven from men and ate grass like oxen; and his body was wet with the dew of the sky until his hair had grown like eagles’ feathers, and his nails like birds’ claws.\n     [34] At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my understanding returned to me; and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honored him who lives forever,\n  for his dominion is an everlasting dominion,\n    and his kingdom from generation to generation.\n   [35] All the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing;\n    and he does according to his will in the army of heaven,\n    and among the inhabitants of the earth;\n  and no one can stop his hand,\n    or ask him, “What are you doing?”\n     [36] At the same time my understanding returned to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and brightness returned to me. My counselors and my lords sought me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent greatness was added to me.  [37] Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven; for all his works are truth, and his ways justice; and those who walk in pride he is able to abase.\n"

[2] Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded that the golden and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem be brought to him, that the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, might drink from them.  [3] Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of God’s house which was at Jerusalem; and the king and His lords, His wives and His concubines, drank from them.  [4] They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of bronze, of iron, of wood, and of stone.\n     [5] In the same hour, the fingers of a man’s hand came out and wrote near the lamp stand on the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace. The king saw the part of the hand that wrote.  [6] Then the king’s face was changed in him, and his thoughts troubled him; and the joints of his thighs were loosened, and his knees struck one against another.\n     [7] The king cried aloud to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. The king spoke and said to the wise men of Babylon, “Whoever reads this writing and shows me its interpretation shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.”\n     [8] Then all the king’s wise men came in; but they could not read the writing, and couldn’t make known to the king the interpretation.  [9] Then King Belshazzar was greatly troubled, and his face was changed in him, and his lords were perplexed.\n     [10] The queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house. The queen spoke and said, “O king, live forever; don’t let your thoughts trouble you, nor let your face be changed.  [11] There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of your father, light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, were found in him. The king, Nebuchadnezzar, your father—yes, the king, your father—made him master of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and soothsayers,  [12] because an excellent spirit, knowledge, understanding, interpreting of dreams, showing of dark sentences, and dissolving of doubts were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.”\n     [13] Then Daniel was brought in before the king. The king spoke and said to Daniel, “Are you that Daniel of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah?  [14] I have heard of you, that the spirit of the gods is in you and that light, understanding, and excellent wisdom are found in you.  [15] Now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known to me its interpretation; but they could not show the interpretation of the thing.  [16] But I have heard of you, that you can give interpretations and dissolve doubts. Now if you can read the writing and make known to me its interpretation, you shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold around your neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.”\n     [17] Then Daniel answered before the king, “Let your gifts be to yourself, and give your rewards to another. Nevertheless, I will read the writing to the king, and make known to him the interpretation.\n     [18] “To you, king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father the kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and majesty.  [19] Because of the greatness that he gave him, all the peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him. He killed whom he wanted to, and he kept alive whom he wanted to. He raised up whom he wanted to, and he put down whom he wanted to.  [20] But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him.  [21] He was driven from the sons of men, and His heart was made like the animals’, and His dwelling was with the wild donkeys. He was fed with grass like oxen, and His body was wet with the dew of the sky, until He knew that the Most High God rules in the kingdom of men, and that He sets up over it whomever He will.\n     [22] “You, his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this,  [23] but have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of His house before you, and you and your lords, your wives, and your concubines, have drunk wine from them. You have praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which don’t see, or hear, or know; and you have not glorified the God in whose hand your breath is, and whose are all your ways.  [24] Then the part of the hand was sent from before him, and this writing was inscribed.\n     [25] “This is the writing that was inscribed: ‘MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.’\n     [26] “This is the interpretation of the thing:\nMENE: God has counted your kingdom, and brought it to an end.\n [27] TEKEL: you are weighed in the balances, and are found wanting.\n [28] PERES: your kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.”\n     [29] Then Belshazzar commanded, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.\n     [30] In that night Belshazzar the Chaldean King was slain.  [31] Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old.\n"

[3] Then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the local governors, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.\n     [4] Then the presidents and the local governors sought to find occasion against Daniel as touching the kingdom; but they could find no occasion or fault, because he was faithful. There wasn’t any error or fault found in him.  [5] Then these men said, “We won’t find any occasion against this Daniel, unless we find it against Him concerning the law of His God.”\n     [6] Then these presidents and local governors assembled together to the king, and said this to him, “King Darius, live forever!  [7] All the presidents of the kingdom, the deputies and the local governors, the counselors and the governors, have consulted together to establish a royal statute and to make a strong decree, that whoever asks a petition of any god or man for thirty days, except of you, O king, He shall be cast into the den of lions.  [8] Now, O king, establish the decree and sign the writing, that it not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which doesn’t alter.”  [9] Therefore King Darius signed the writing and the decree.\n     [10] When Daniel knew that the writing was signed, He went into His house (now His windows were open in His room toward Jerusalem) and He kneeled on His knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before His God, as He did before.  [11] Then these men assembled together, and found Daniel making petition and supplication before His God.  [12] Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the king’s decree: “Haven’t you signed a decree that every man who makes a petition to any god or man within thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?”\n    The king answered, “This thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which doesn’t alter.”\n     [13] Then they answered and said before the king, “That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, doesn’t respect you, O king, nor the decree that you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day.”  [14] Then the king, when he heard these words, was very displeased, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him; and he labored until the going down of the sun to rescue him.\n     [15] Then these men assembled together to the king, and said to the king, “Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no decree nor statute which the king establishes may be changed.”\n     [16] Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel and cast Him into the den of lions. The king spoke and said to Daniel, “Your God whom you serve continually, He will deliver you.”\n     [17] A stone was brought, and laid on the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.  [18] Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting. No musical instruments were brought before him; and his sleep fled from him.\n     [19] Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste to the den of lions.  [20] When He came near to the den to Daniel, He cried with a troubled voice. The king spoke and said to Daniel, “Daniel, servant of the living God, is your God, whom you serve continually, able to deliver you from the lions?”\n     [21] Then Daniel said to the king, “O king, live forever!  [22] My God has sent His angel, and has shut the lions’ mouths, and they have not hurt me, because innocence was found in me before Him; and also before you, O king, I have done no harm.”\n     [23] Then the king was exceedingly glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no kind of harm was found on Him, because He had trusted in His God.\n     [24] The king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions—them, their children, and their wives; and the lions mauled them, and broke all their bones in pieces before they came to the bottom of the den.\n     [25] Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages who dwell in all the earth:\n    “Peace be multiplied to you.\n     [26] “I make a decree that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel.\n  “For He is the living God,\n    and steadfast forever.\n  His kingdom is that which will not be destroyed.\n    His dominion will be even to the end.\n   [27] He delivers and rescues.\n    He works signs and wonders in heaven and in earth,\n    who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.”\n     [28] So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.\n"

Then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters.\n     [2] Daniel spoke and said, “I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the sky broke out on the great sea.  [3] Four great animals came up from the sea, different from one another.\n     [4] “The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings. I watched until its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth and made to stand on two feet as a man. A man’s heart was given to it.\n     [5] “Behold, there was another animal, a second, like a bear. It was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth. They said this to it: ‘Arise! Devour much flesh!’\n     [6] “After this I saw, and behold, another, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird. The animal also had four heads; and dominion was given to it.\n     [7] “After this I saw in the night visions, and, behold, there was a fourth animal, awesome, powerful, and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth. It devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet. It was different from all the animals that were before it. It had ten horns.\n     [8] “I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots; and behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking arrogantly.\n   [9] “I watched until thrones were placed,\n    and one who was ancient of days sat.\n  His clothing was white as snow,\n    and the hair of his head like pure wool.\n  His throne was fiery flames,\n    and its wheels burning fire.\n   [10] A fiery stream issued and came out from before him.\n    Thousands of thousands ministered to him.\n    Ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him.\n  The judgment was set.\n    The books were opened.\n     [11] “I watched at that time because of the voice of the arrogant words which the horn spoke. I watched even until the animal was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire.  [12] As for the rest of the animals, their dominion was taken away; yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.\n     [13] “I saw in the night visions, and behold, there came with the clouds of the sky one like a son of man, and he came even to the Ancient of Days, and they brought him near before him.  [14] Dominion was given him, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which will not pass away, and his kingdom one that will not be destroyed.\n     [15] “As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved within my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.  [16] I came near to one of those who stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this.\n    “So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.  [17] ‘These great animals, which are four, are four kings, who will arise out of the earth.  [18] But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.’\n     [19] “Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth animal, which was different from all of them, exceedingly terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of bronze; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet;  [20] and concerning the ten horns that were on its head and the other horn which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes and a mouth that spoke arrogantly, whose look was more stout than its fellows.  [21] I saw, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them,  [22] until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.\n     [23] “So he said, ‘The fourth animal will be a fourth kingdom on earth, which will be different from all the kingdoms, and will devour the whole earth, and will tread it down and break it in pieces.  [24] As for the ten horns, ten kings will arise out of this kingdom. Another will arise after them; and he will be different from the former, and he will put down three kings.  [25] He will speak words against the Most High, and will wear out the saints of the Most High. He will plan to change the times and the law; and they will be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.\n     [26] “‘But the judgment will be set, and they will take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it to the end.  [27] The kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole sky, will be given to the people of the saints of the Most High. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions will serve and obey him.’\n     [28] “Here is the end of the matter.

Now it was so, that when I saw, I was in the citadel of Susa, which is in the province of Elam. I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai.  [3] Then I lifted up my eyes and saw, and behold, a ram which had two horns stood before the river. The two horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.  [4] I saw the ram pushing westward, northward, and southward. No animals could stand before him. There wasn’t any who could deliver out of his hand, but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.\n     [5] As I was considering, behold, a male goat came from the west over the surface of the whole earth, and didn’t touch the ground. The goat had a notable horn between his eyes.  [6] He came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran on him in the fury of his power.  [7] I saw him come close to the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and struck the ram, and broke his two horns. There was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground and trampled on him. There was no one who could deliver the ram out of his hand.  [8] The male goat magnified himself exceedingly. When he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable horns toward the four winds of the sky.\n     [9] Out of one of them came out a little horn which grew exceedingly great—toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious land.  [10] It grew great, even to the army of the sky; and it cast down some of the army and of the stars to the ground and trampled on them.  [11] Yes, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the army; and it took away from him the continual burnt offering, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.  [12] The army was given over to it together with the continual burnt offering through disobedience. It cast down truth to the ground, and it did its pleasure and prospered.\n     [13] Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said to that certain one who spoke, “How long will the vision about the continual burnt offering, and the disobedience that makes desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the army to be trodden under foot be?”\n     [14] He said to me, “To two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings. Then the sanctuary will be cleansed.”\n     [15] When I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it. Then behold, there stood before me someone with the appearance of a man.  [16] I heard a man’s voice between the banks of the Ulai, which called and said, “Gabriel, make this man understand the vision.”\n     [17] So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was frightened, and fell on my face; but he said to me, “Understand, son of man, for the vision belongs to the time of the end.”\n     [18] Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me and set me upright.\n     [19] He said, “Behold, I will make you know what will be in the latter time of the indignation, for it belongs to the appointed time of the end.  [20] The ram which you saw, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia.  [21] The rough male goat is the king of Greece. The great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.  [22] As for that which was broken, in the place where four stood up, four kingdoms will stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.\n     [23] “In the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors have come to the full, a king of fierce face, and understanding riddles, will stand up.  [24] His power will be mighty, but not by his own power. He will destroy awesomely, and will prosper in what he does. He will destroy the mighty ones and the holy people.  [25] Through his policy he will cause deceit to prosper in his hand. He will magnify himself in his heart, and he will destroy many in their security. He will also stand up against the prince of princes, but he will be broken without human hands.\n     [26] “The vision of the evenings and mornings which has been told is true; but seal up the vision, for it belongs to many days to come.”\n     [27] I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick for some days. Then I rose up and did the king’s business. I wondered at the vision, but no one understood it.\n"

[3] I set my face to the Lord God, to seek by prayer and petitions, with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.\n     [4] I prayed to Yahweh my God, and made confession, and said,\n    “Oh, Lord, the great and dreadful God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness with those who love Him and keep His commandments,  [5] we have sinned, and have dealt perversely, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even turning aside from your precepts and from your ordinances.  [6] We haven’t listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.\n     [7] “Lord, righteousness belongs to you, but to us confusion of face, as it is today; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, who are near and who are far off, through all the countries where you have driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against you.  [8] Lord, to us belongs confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against you.  [9] To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against Him.  [10] We haven’t obeyed Yahweh our God’s voice, to walk in His laws, which He set before us by His servants the prophets.  [11] Yes, all Israel have transgressed your law, turning aside, that they should not obey your voice.\n    “Therefore the curse and the oath written in the law of Moses the servant of God has been poured out on us, for we have sinned against Him.  [12] He has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us and against our judges who judged us, by bringing on us a great evil; for under the whole sky, such has not been done as has been done to Jerusalem.  [13] As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil has come on us. Yet we have not entreated the favor of Yahweh our God, that we should turn from our iniquities and have discernment in your truth.  [14] Therefore Yahweh has watched over the evil, and brought it on us; for Yahweh our God is righteous in all His works which He does, and we have not obeyed His voice.\n     [15] “Now, Lord our God, who has brought your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and have gotten yourself renown, as it is today, we have sinned. We have done wickedly.  [16] Lord, according to all your righteousness, please let your anger and your wrath be turned away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain; because for our sins and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and your people have become a reproach to all who are around us.\n     [17] “Now therefore, our God, listen to the prayer of your servant and to His petitions, and cause your face to shine on your sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord’s sake.  [18] My God, turn your ear and hear. Open your eyes and see our desolations, and the city which is called by your name; for we do not present our petitions before you for our righteousness, but for your great mercies’ sake.  [19] Lord, hear. Lord, forgive. Lord, listen and do. Don’t defer, for your own sake, my God, because your city and your people are called by your name.”\n    \n     [20] While I was speaking, praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before Yahweh my God for the holy mountain of my God—  [21] yes, while I was speaking in prayer—the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening offering.  [22] He instructed me and talked with me, and said, “Daniel, I have now come to give you wisdom and understanding.  [23] At the beginning of your petitions the commandment went out, and I have come to tell you, for you are greatly beloved. Therefore consider the matter and understand the vision.\n     [24] “Seventy weeks are decreed on your people and on your holy city, to finish disobedience, to make an end of sins, to make reconciliation for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most holy.\n     [25] “Know therefore and discern that from the going out of the commandment to restore and build Jerusalem to the Anointed One, the prince, will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks. It will be built again, with street and moat, even in troubled times.  [26] After the sixty-two weeks the Anointed One will be cut off, and will have nothing. The people of the prince who come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end will be with a flood, and war will be even to the end. Desolations are determined.  [27] He will make a firm covenant with many for one week. In the middle of the week he will cause the sacrifice and the offering to cease. On the wing of abominations will come one who makes desolate; and even to the decreed full end, wrath will be poured out on the desolate.”\n"

          "content": "     [1] In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a message was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the message was true, even a great warfare. He understood the message, and had understanding of the vision.\n     [2] In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three whole weeks.  [3] I ate no pleasant food. No meat or wine came into my mouth. I didn’t anoint myself at all, until three whole weeks were fulfilled.\n     [4] In the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel,  [5] I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a man clothed in linen, whose waist was adorned with pure gold of Uphaz.  [6] His body also was like beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as flaming torches. His arms and his feet were like burnished bronze. The voice of his words was like the voice of a multitude.\n     [7] I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me didn’t see the vision, but a great quaking fell on them, and they fled to hide themselves.  [8] So I was left alone and saw this great vision. No strength remained in me; for my face grew deathly pale, and I retained no strength.  [9] Yet I heard the voice of his words. When I heard the voice of his words, then I fell into a deep sleep on my face, with my face toward the ground.\n     [10] Behold, a hand touched me, which set me on my knees and on the palms of my hands.  [11] He said to me, “Daniel, you greatly beloved man, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright, for I have been sent to you, now.” When he had spoken this word to me, I stood trembling.\n     [12] Then He said to me, “Don’t be afraid, Daniel; for from the first day that you set your heart to understand, and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard. I have come for your words’ sake.  [13] But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days; but, behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me because I remained there with the kings of Persia.  [14] Now I have come to make you understand what will happen to your people in the latter days, for the vision is yet for many days.”\n     [15] When he had spoken these words to me, I set my face toward the ground and was mute.  [16] Behold, one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth, and spoke and said to him who stood before me, “My lord, by reason of the vision my sorrows have overtaken me, and I retain no strength.  [17] For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? For as for me, immediately there remained no strength in me. There was no breath left in me.”\n     [18] Then one like the appearance of a man touched me again, and he strengthened me.  [19] He said, “Greatly beloved man, don’t be afraid. Peace be to you. Be strong. Yes, be strong.”\n    When he spoke to me, I was strengthened, and said, “Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.”\n     [20] Then he said, “Do you know why I have come to you? Now I will return to fight with the prince of Persia. When I go out, behold, the prince of Greece will come.  [21] But I will tell you that which is inscribed in the writing of truth. There is no one who holds with me against these but Michael your prince.\n"

          "content": "     [1] “As for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to confirm and strengthen him.\n     [2] “Now I will show you the truth. Behold, three more kings will stand up in Persia. The fourth will be far richer than all of them. When he has grown strong through his riches, he will stir up all against the realm of Greece.  [3] A mighty king will stand up, who will rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.  [4] When he stands up, his kingdom will be broken and will be divided toward the four winds of the sky, but not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion with which he ruled; for his kingdom will be plucked up, even for others besides these.\n     [5] “The king of the south will be strong. One of his princes will become stronger than him, and have dominion. His dominion will be a great dominion.  [6] At the end of years they will join themselves together; and the daughter of the king of the south will come to the king of the north to make an agreement, but she will not retain the strength of her arm. He will also not stand, nor will his arm; but she will be given up, with those who brought her, and he who became the father of her, and he who strengthened her in those times.\n     [7] “But out of a shoot from her roots one will stand up in his place, who will come to the army and will enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and will deal against them and will prevail.  [8] He will also carry their gods with their molten images, and with their goodly vessels of silver and of gold, captive into Egypt. He will refrain some years from the king of the north.  [9] He will come into the realm of the king of the south, but he will return into his own land.  [10] His sons will wage war, and will assemble a multitude of great forces which will come on, and overflow, and pass through. They will return and wage war, even to his fortress.\n     [11] “The king of the south will be moved with anger and will come out and fight with him, even with the king of the north. He will send out a great multitude, and the multitude will be given into his hand.  [12] The multitude will be carried off, and his heart will be exalted. He will cast down tens of thousands, but he won’t prevail.  [13] The king of the north will return, and will send out a multitude greater than the former. He will come on at the end of the times, even of years, with a great army and with abundant supplies.\n     [14] “In those times many will stand up against the king of the south. Also the children of the violent among your people will lift themselves up to establish the vision, but they will fall.  [15] So the king of the north will come and cast up a mound, and take a well-fortified city. The forces of the south won’t stand, neither will his select troops, neither will there be any strength to stand.  [16] But he who comes against him will do according to his own will, and no one will stand before him. He will stand in the glorious land, and destruction will be in his hand.  [17] He will set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and with him equitable conditions. He will perform them. He will give him the daughter of women, to destroy the kingdom, but she will not stand, and won’t be for him.  [18] After this he will turn his face to the islands, and will take many, but a prince will cause the reproach offered by him to cease. Yes, moreover, he will cause his reproach to turn on him.  [19] Then he will turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land; but he will stumble and fall, and won’t be found.\n     [20] “Then one who will cause a tax collector to pass through the kingdom to maintain its glory will stand up in his place; but within few days he shall be destroyed, not in anger, and not in battle.\n     [21] “In his place a contemptible person will stand up, to whom they had not given the honor of the kingdom; but he will come in time of security, and will obtain the kingdom by flatteries.  [22] The overwhelming forces will be overwhelmed from before him, and will be broken. Yes, also the prince of the covenant.  [23] After the treaty made with him he will work deceitfully; for he will come up and will become strong with few people.  [24] In time of security he will come even on the fattest places of the province. He will do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers’ fathers. He will scatter among them prey, plunder, and wealth. Yes, he will devise his plans against the strongholds, but only for a time.\n     [25] “He will stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south will wage war in battle with an exceedingly great and mighty army, but he won’t stand; for they will devise plans against him.  [26] Yes, those who eat of his delicacies will destroy him, and his army will be swept away. Many will fall down slain.  [27] As for both these kings, their hearts will be to do evil, and they will speak lies at one table; but it won’t prosper, for the end will still be at the appointed time.  [28] Then he will return into his land with great wealth. His heart will be against the holy covenant. He will take action, and return to his own land.\n     [29] “He will return at the appointed time and come into the south; but it won’t be in the latter time as it was in the former.  [30] For ships of Kittim will come against him. Therefore he will be grieved, and will return, and have indignation against the holy covenant, and will take action. He will even return, and have regard to those who forsake the holy covenant.\n     [31] “Forces from him will profane the sanctuary, even the fortress, and will take away the continual burnt offering. Then they will set up the abomination that makes desolate.  [32] He will corrupt those who do wickedly against the covenant by flatteries; but the people who know their God will be strong and take action.\n     [33] “Those who are wise among the people will instruct many; yet they will fall by the sword and by flame, by captivity and by plunder, many days.  [34] Now when they fall, they will be helped with a little help; but many will join themselves to them with flatteries.  [35] Some of those who are wise will fall—to refine them, and to purify, and to make them white, even to the time of the end, because it is yet for the time appointed.\n     [36] “The king will do according to His will. He will exalt Himself and magnify Himself above every god, and will speak marvelous things against the God of gods. He will prosper until the indignation is accomplished, for that which is determined will be done.  [37] He won’t regard the gods of His fathers, or the desire of women, or regard any god; for He will magnify Himself above all.  [38] But in their place, He will honor the god of fortresses. He will honor a god whom His fathers didn’t know with gold, silver, and with precious stones and pleasant things.  [39] He will deal with the strongest fortresses by the help of a foreign god. He will increase with glory whoever acknowledges Him. He will cause them to rule over many, and will divide the land for a price.\n     [40] “At the time of the end the king of the south will contend with him; and the king of the north will come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, with horsemen, and with many ships. He will enter into the countries, and will overflow and pass through.  [41] He will enter also into the glorious land, and many countries will be overthrown; but these will be delivered out of his hand: Edom, Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.  [42] He will also stretch out his hand on the countries. The land of Egypt won’t escape.  [43] But he will have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt. The Libyans and the Ethiopians will follow his steps.  [44] But news out of the east and out of the north will trouble him; and he will go out with great fury to destroy and utterly to sweep away many.  [45] He will plant the tents of his palace between the sea and the glorious holy mountain; yet he will come to his end, and no one will help him.\n"

[6] How Esau will be ransacked! How his hidden treasures are sought out!  [7] All the men of your alliance have brought you on your way, even to the border. The men who were at peace with you have deceived you, and prevailed against you. Friends who eat your bread lay a snare under you.

[10] For the violence done to your brother Jacob, shame will cover you, and you will be cut off forever.  [11] In the day that you stood on the other side, in the day that strangers carried away his substance and foreigners entered into his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem, even you were like one of them.  [12] But don’t look down on your brother in the day of his disaster, and don’t rejoice over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction. Don’t speak proudly in the day of distress.

The house of Jacob will possess their possessions.  [18] The house of Jacob will be a fire, the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble. They will burn among them and devour them. There will not be any remaining to the house of Esau.” Indeed, Yahweh has spoken.\n     [19] Those of the South will possess the mountain of Esau, and those of the lowland, the Philistines. They will possess the field of Ephraim, and the field of Samaria. Benjamin will possess Gilead.

Then the sea will be calm for you; for I know that because of me this great storm is on you.”\n     [13] Nevertheless the men rowed hard to get them back to the land; but they could not, for the sea grew more and more stormy against them.

How long?’  [7] Won’t your debtors rise up suddenly, and wake up those who make you tremble, and you will be their victim?  [8] Because you have plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples will plunder you because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all who dwell in it.\n     [9] Woe to him who gets an evil gain for his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the hand of evil!  [10] You have devised shame to your house by cutting off many peoples, and have sinned against your soul.  [11] For the stone will cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the woodwork will answer it.\n     [12] Woe to him who builds a town with blood, and establishes a city by iniquity!  [13] Behold, isn’t it from Yahweh of Armies that the peoples labor for the fire, and the nations weary themselves for vanity?  [14] For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Yahweh’s glory, as the waters cover the sea.\n     [15] “Woe to him who gives his neighbor drink, pouring your inflaming wine until they are drunk, so that you may gaze at their naked bodies!  [16] You are filled with shame, and not glory. You will also drink and be exposed! The cup of Yahweh’s right hand will come around to you, and disgrace will cover your glory.  [17] For the violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, and the destruction of the animals will terrify you, because of men’s blood and for the violence done to the land, to every city and to those who dwell in them.\n     [18] “What value does the engraved image have, that its maker has engraved it; the molten image, even the teacher of lies, that he who fashions its form trusts in it, to make mute idols?  [19] Woe to him who says to the wood, ‘Awake!’ or to the mute stone, ‘Arise!’ Shall this teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all within it.

I will cut off man from the surface of the earth, says Yahweh.  [4] I will stretch out my hand against Judah and against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place—the name of the idolatrous and pagan priests,  [5] those who worship the army of the sky on the housetops, those who worship and swear by Yahweh and also swear by Malcam,  [6] those who have turned back from following Yahweh, and those who haven’t sought Yahweh nor inquired after Him.\n     [7] Be silent at the presence of the Lord Yahweh, for the day of Yahweh is at hand. For Yahweh has prepared a sacrifice. He has consecrated His guests.  [8] It will happen in the day of Yahweh’s sacrifice that I will punish the princes, the king’s sons, and all those who are clothed with foreign clothing.  [9] In that day, I will punish all those who leap over the threshold, who fill their master’s house with violence and deceit.\n     [10] In that day, says Yahweh, there will be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, a wailing from the second quarter, and a great crashing from the hills.  [11] Wail, you inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the people of Canaan are undone! All those who were loaded with silver are cut off.  [12] It will happen at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and I will punish the men who are settled on their dregs, who say in their heart, “Yahweh will not do good, neither will He do evil.”  [13] Their wealth will become a plunder, and their houses a desolation. Yes, they will build houses, but won’t inhabit them. They will plant vineyards, but won’t drink their wine.\n     [14] The great day of Yahweh is near. It is near and hurries greatly, the voice of the day of Yahweh. The mighty man cries there bitterly.  [15] That day is a day of wrath, a day of distress and anguish, a day of trouble and ruin, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and blackness,  [16] a day of the trumpet and alarm against the fortified cities and against the high battlements.  [17] I will bring such distress on men that they will walk like blind men because they have sinned against Yahweh. Their blood will be poured out like dust and their flesh like dung.  [18] Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to deliver them in the day of Yahweh’s wrath, but the whole land will be devoured by the fire of His jealousy; for He will make an end, yes, a terrible end, of all those who dwell in the land.\n"

[7] It will be a unique day which is known to Yahweh—not day, and not night; but it will come to pass that at evening time there will be light.\n     [8] It will happen in that day that living waters will go out from Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea, and half of them toward the western sea. It will be so in summer and in winter.\n     [9] Yahweh will be King over all the earth. In that day Yahweh will be one, and His name one.\n     [10] All the land will be made like the Arabah, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; and she will be lifted up and will dwell in her place, from Benjamin’s gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananel to the king’s wine presses.  [11] Men will dwell therein, and there will be no more curse; but Jerusalem will dwell safely.\n     [12] This will be the plague with which Yahweh will strike all the peoples who have fought against Jerusalem: their flesh will consume away while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will consume away in their sockets, and their tongue will consume away in their mouth.  [13] It will happen in that day that a great panic from Yahweh will be among them; and they will each seize the hand of His neighbor, and His hand will rise up against the hand of His neighbor.  [14] Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered together: gold, silver, and clothing, in great abundance.\n     [15] A plague like this will fall on the horse, on the mule, on the camel, on the donkey, and on all the animals that will be in those camps.\n     [16] It will happen that everyone who is left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, Yahweh of Armies, and to keep the feast of booths.  [17] It will be that whoever of all the families of the earth doesn’t go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, Yahweh of Armies, on them there will be no rain.  [18] If the family of Egypt doesn’t go up and doesn’t come, neither will it rain on them. This will be the plague with which Yahweh will strike the nations that don’t go up to keep the feast of booths.  [19] This will be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nations that don’t go up to keep the feast of booths.\n     [20] In that day there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, “HOLY TO YAHWEH”; and the pots in Yahweh’s house will be like the bowls before the altar.  [21] Yes, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to Yahweh of Armies; and all those who sacrifice will come and take of them, and cook in them. In that day there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of Yahweh of Armies.\n"

If I am a father, then where is my honor? And if I am a master, where is the respect due me?” says Yahweh of Armies to you priests who despise my name. “You say, ‘How have we despised your name?’  [7] You offer polluted bread on my altar. You say, ‘How have we polluted you?’ In that you say, ‘Yahweh’s table is contemptible.’  [8] When you offer the blind for sacrifice, isn’t that evil? And when you offer the lame and sick, isn’t that evil? Present it now to your governor! Will He be pleased with you? Or will He accept your person?” says Yahweh of Armies.\n     [9] “Now, please entreat the favor of God, that He may be gracious to us. With this, will He accept any of you?” says Yahweh of Armies.\n     [10] “Oh that there were one among you who would shut the doors, that you might not kindle fire on my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you,” says Yahweh of Armies, “neither will I accept an offering at your hand.  [11] For from the rising of the sun even to its going down, my name is great among the nations, and in every place incense will be offered to my name, and a pure offering; for my name is great among the nations,” says Yahweh of Armies.  [12] “But you profane it when you say, ‘Yahweh’s table is polluted, and its fruit, even its food, is contemptible.’  [13] You say also, ‘Behold, what a weariness it is!’ And you have sniffed at it”, says Yahweh of Armies; “and you have brought that which was taken by violence, the lame, and the sick; thus you bring the offering. Should I accept this at your hand?” says Yahweh.\n     [14] “But the deceiver is cursed who has in His flock a male, and vows and sacrifices to the Lord a defective thing; for I am a great King,” says Yahweh of Armies, “and my name is awesome among the nations.”\n"

[2] If you will not listen, and if you will not take it to heart, to give glory to my name,” says Yahweh of Armies, “then I will send the curse on you, and I will curse your blessings. Indeed, I have cursed them already, because you do not take it to heart.  [3] Behold, I will rebuke your offspring, and will spread dung on your faces, even the dung of your feasts; and you will be taken away with it.  [4] You will know that I have sent this commandment to you, that my covenant may be with Levi,” says Yahweh of Armies.  [5] “My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him that he might be reverent toward me; and he was reverent toward me, and stood in awe of my name.  [6] The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many away from iniquity.  [7] For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at His mouth; for He is the messenger of Yahweh of Armies.  [8] But you have turned away from the path. You have caused many to stumble in the law. You have corrupted the covenant of Levi,” says Yahweh of Armies.  [9] “Therefore I have also made you contemptible and wicked before all the people, according to the way you have not kept my ways, but have had respect for persons in the law.  [10] Don’t we all have one father? Hasn’t one God created us? Why do we deal treacherously every man against His brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers?  [11] Judah has dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the holiness of Yahweh which He loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.  [12] Yahweh will cut off the man who does this, Him who wakes and Him who answers, out of the tents of Jacob and Him who offers an offering to Yahweh of Armies.\n     [13] “This again you do: you cover Yahweh’s altar with tears, with weeping, and with sighing, because He doesn’t regard the offering any more, neither receives it with good will at your hand.  [14] Yet you say, ‘Why?’ Because Yahweh has been witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have dealt treacherously, though she is your companion and the wife of your covenant.  [15] Did he not make you one, although he had the residue of the Spirit? Why one? He sought godly offspring. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let no one deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.  [16] One who hates and divorces”, says Yahweh, the God of Israel, “covers His garment with violence!” says Yahweh of Armies. “Therefore pay attention to your spirit, that you don’t be unfaithful.\n     [17] You have wearied Yahweh with your words. Yet you say, ‘How have we wearied Him?’ In that you say, ‘Everyone who does evil is good in Yahweh’s sight, and He delights in them;’ or ‘Where is the God of justice?’\n"

For he is like a refiner’s fire, and like launderers’ soap;  [3] and He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and He will purify the sons of Levi, and refine them as gold and silver; and they shall offer to Yahweh offerings in righteousness.  [4] Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasant to Yahweh as in the days of old and as in ancient years.\n     [5] I will come near to you to judgment. I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, against the adulterers, against the perjurers, and against those who oppress the hireling in His wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and who deprive the foreigner of justice, and don’t fear me,” says Yahweh of Armies.\n     [6] “For I, Yahweh, don’t change; therefore you, sons of Jacob, are not consumed.  [7] From the days of your fathers you have turned away from my ordinances and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you,” says Yahweh of Armies. “But you say, ‘How shall we return?’\n     [8] Will a man rob God? Yet you rob me! But you say, ‘How have we robbed you?’ In tithes and offerings.  [9] You are cursed with the curse; for you rob me, even this whole nation.  [10] Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house, and test me now in this,” says Yahweh of Armies, “if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there will not be enough room for.  [11] I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and He shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before its time in the field,” says Yahweh of Armies.

[15] Now we call the proud happy; yes, those who work wickedness are built up; yes, they tempt God, and escape.’\n     [16] Then those who feared Yahweh spoke one with another; and Yahweh listened and heard, and a book of memory was written before Him for those who feared Yahweh and who honored His name.  [17] They shall be mine,” says Yahweh of Armies, “my own possession in the day that I make. I will spare them, as a man spares His own son who serves Him.
